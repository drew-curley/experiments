230711306,1TI,6,10,For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.

205529090,GAL,2,2,"I went up because of a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles.

205529097,GAL,2,9,"When James, Cephas, and John, who had a reputation as pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles and they should go to the circumcised.","Akanya Yakobo, Kefa na Yohana kibhamanyikile kubha bhakomeka ekanisa, bhakamanya echisa echinaheibwe, inye bhahatwekwasa omubhumo nyawe na Barnaba .

205529101,GAL,2,13,Also the rest of the Jews joined in this hypocrisy. Even Barnabas was led astray with them by their hypocrisy.,"Omukuyendeleza, abhayahudi abhandi bhakebwata hamo nobwangi obwo hamo na Kefa. Echa negilaho bhikabha bhiti, na Barnaba akatwalwa nobwangi bwabho."
205529102,GAL,2,14,"But when I saw that their behavior was not following the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of all of them, ""If you are a Jew but are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?""","Chonka kinabweine kubha wakabha bhatakuhondeka evanjeli yamazima nkamugambila Kefa omumaiso gabho bhona, ""Imwe muliabhayuda chonka nimwikala nemize yabhantu bhamahanga kandi mwakwikeile nemize yabhayuda.

205529104,GAL,2,16,yet we know that no person is justified by the works of the law but through faith in Christ Jesus. So we also have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law. For by the works of the law no flesh will be justified.,Tukaija omumwesigo omunda ya Kristu Yesu ahongu tubhalirwe mazima omumwesigo omunda ya Kristo na tabhikorwa byomuku. ahabhikorwa byomuku taliho omubhili ogulibhalirwa amazima.
205529105,GAL,2,17,"But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? Absolutely not!","Chonka nkukutuli kumuhiga Mungu ahakubhalirwa amazima omunda ya Kristu, nitwesanga itwe twabheile abhamafu, ngu Kristu akakorwa omzana wanafunzi tikwao chili!"

205533190,GAL,3,6,"Just as Abraham ""believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness,""",Abrahimu Ake Mungu yabharwa kubha howa mazima.
205533191,GAL,3,7,"in the same way, understand, then, that those of faith are the children of Abraham.",Homu bighiro kebyo habha kuami ni nabhana bha Abrahimu.
205533192,GAL,3,8,"The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ""In you all the nations will be blessed.""","Ebhiandiko bhikavangirilwa hokwo Mungu, bha mahanga bhonagha gharatungurwa."
205533193,GAL,3,9,"So then, those of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.",Horwo kubha hakanya hakarijao bharia habhaine omure sigho bhatughurwe hamo na Abrahimu holiahaya bhaine haine omwesigho.
205533194,GAL,3,10,"All who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; and so it is written, ""Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the law, and do them.""","Bhalia habha kwesigha hebikorwa bya mateka bhari hahasi ye miramo.

205533195,GAL,3,11,"Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because ""the righteous will live by faith.""","""Mbwenu na mazima Mungu takubharila maima wenawena horwa matekha, horwo kubha howa mazima na hijanahija kubha no mwesigho""."
205533196,GAL,3,12,"But the law is not of faith; rather, ""The person who does the works of the law must live by them.""","Amateka tigharugha mumwesigho, sana hemuma yabya nokukora ""Hebhintu hebhi homuma  teka, bahija kutura na matecha."
205533197,GAL,3,13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, ""Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree""—",Kristo hakaturokora hetwe kurugha homu mumuramo gwa matekha homukanya hakoya kubha chiandi kirwe.

205533198,GAL,3,14,"so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.","Esongha hekabha heli hemighisa heza bhaire zine Ibrahimu zikazire homu bhantu bha mahanga homuli Kristo Yesu, tubhase tukwata hechiraghano cho mwoyo kurabha homu kwesigha."
205533199,GAL,3,15,"Brothers, let me speak in human terms. Once a man-made contract is established by law, no one can set it aside or add to it.","Barumana, nifumola homubhigiro bya bhantu. Mpaka hakanya heiraghano lya ntu lyabhaireghe, Tario hakubhasa kubyesiza hanga kub'yongeza."
205533200,GAL,3,16,"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. It does not say, ""to descendants,"" referring to many, but instead to only one, ""and to your descendant,"" who is Christ.","Mbwenu hendaghano zikagha mbwa na Ibtahimu no ruzaro rwe. The kighamba, no mezaro, ""kumanyisa bheighi, hanyuma yawene homo wekha, ""hobworu ruzao twe hayabhaire hari Kristo."
205533201,GAL,3,17,"Now what I am saying is this: The law, which came 430 years afterward, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God, to nullify the promise.","Mbwenu nighamba nthi, heitekha harya hizire omumiaka 430 homunyahakakwijaho thichikwiyao ndagano ya nyumahey ateirweona Mungu."
205533202,GAL,3,18,"For if the inheritance comes by the law, then it no longer comes by promise. But God freely gave it to Abraham by a promise.",Kubha hobhusika bwakuizire homu handa gwa matekhatigwa kwizire rundi homuanda gwe ndaghano.
205533203,GAL,3,19,"What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the descendant of Abraham would come to whom the promise had been made. The law was ordained through angels by the hand of an intermediary.","Mbwenu kubhaki heiteka iyakirweo? Likahongezibwa horwe songa ya mafu ghaitu, mpaka homuzarwa wa Ibrahimu habhase kwija halitekharika tekwao hobwe chiraghirizo kurabha hami konoya bhamaraika habhakughoshora."
205533204,GAL,3,20,Now an intermediary implies more than one person. But God is one.,"Mbwenu habhaghosozi bhabhaho muntu homo no kughenderela, chonka Mungu nomowekha."
205533205,GAL,3,21,"So is the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.",Mbwenu si heitekha herihachihaighuru ye hendaghano za Mungu? mbwenu hawo!! kubha heitekha hevya bheire litorewe karya kuzoire hobhubhasa bwo kuretha hobwola.

205533206,GAL,3,22,But the scripture imprisoned everything under sin so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.,Abwecho hechiandikochikomire hebhintu byona hahansi ya mafhu.

205533207,GAL,3,23,"Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until faith should be revealed.","Chonka hatakabhaireo mwesigho gwa Kristo ghutakaizire, tukabha tukomirwe turi hahansiye tekha mpaka beije urusurulirorwa onwesigho."
205533208,GAL,3,24,"So then the law became our guardian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith.","Abwecho heiteka likasangwao mpaka hakanyako mwebhebebhezi wetu mpaka Kristo hahi yezire, tubhasekubharwa hamazima gho mwesigho."
205533209,GAL,3,25,"But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.",Horwo kubha homwesigho ghukaijha tiluri nabundihaighuru yo murobherezi.

205533212,GAL,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.","Thario Myahudi hangha Myunani, omudhana hanga omuhuru, omusaijahangha omukazi, horwp kubha mwe na muli bhamo liomu Kristo Yesu."
205533213,GAL,3,29,"Then if you are Christ's, you are Abraham's descendants, and heirs according to promise.","Kamurabha muli habha Kristo hawo muli horuzaro lwa Ibrahimu, habha sika twaza ye ndagano."
205537281,GAL,4,1,"I am saying that the heir, for whatever time he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is owner of the entire estate.","Ningamba nti omusika no omwana, tenetofauiti no ompagasi, nobwaalabha niwe msikawe emali yona."
205537282,GAL,4,2,But he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.,"Alwecho, aliansi yo omulebhelezi no mpaka agobhe akonya akiya teleilweo na isewe."
205537283,GAL,4,3,"So also, when we were children, we were enslaved to the elemental principles of the world.","Omulwecho neitwe, olwotwabheite tuli abhana tukabha tukwasilwe ombutumwa obwambele obwensi."
205537284,GAL,4,4,"But when the fullness of time had come, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law","Chonka alanya kika  gobhile, Mungu alatuma omwana we, ayazaitwe no omwazi, yalalwa aansi ye emiango."
205537285,GAL,4,5,"so that he might redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.","Akakole atyo alweensonga yo okulokola abhalyaansi yo obujimbo, ili tukwate elinya ehali yo kubha abhana."
205537286,GAL,4,6,"And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who cries out, ""Abba, Father.""","Alwokubha muliabhana, Mungu atuma omwoyo awo  omwana we omunda yetu, omwoyo ogwobhakwete, ""Abba, Tata""."
205537287,GAL,4,7,"So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then you are also an heir through God.","Alwoensonga ejo iwe tochili mupagasi sanaoli omwana. Kolabha oli omwana, aho iwe omusika kulabhila ali Mungu."
205537288,GAL,4,8,"But at that time, when you did not know God, you were made to be slaves to those who are, by their natural powers, not gods at all.","Nolwo, mwabheile mutakamanyika mangu, mukabha muli abhatumwa omuzalwa owoemiunyu."
205537289,GAL,4,9,"But now that you have come to know God, or rather that you are known by God, how is it that you are turning back to the weak and worthless elemental principles? Do you want to be enslaved all over again?","Chonka hati nimumanya Mungu anga Mungu nabhamanya, kubhachi msubha obhundu kilabhila omianda za enyuma ezitane amalipo gawe? si mwenda kubha abhapagazi obhundi?"

205537293,GAL,4,13,"But you know that it was because of a disease of the flesh that I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time,",Nimumanya nko kubwabheile bhuli obhuraire wo obhili nti nkabhagambila evanjili imwe obwa mbele.
205537294,GAL,4,14,"and though my physical condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.","No obho omubhili olwo gwa bhakile oakejali biwa, timulangaile no kunyanga.

205537300,GAL,4,20,"I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.","Nkubha ninyende kubha nelio neimwe no kundula esati yange, alwokubha nyine amashaka aigulu yanyu."
205537301,GAL,4,21,"Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?","Mungambile, imwe mwenda kubha muliaansi ye emiango,timukulila emiango owekangamba?"
205537302,GAL,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave girl and one by the free woman.","Kubha chiandikilwe chiti Abraamu akabha yeine abhana bhabhili abhabhojo, omo akamuzala amulazi omukozi no ondijo amulazi we."
205537303,GAL,4,23,"One was born by the slave girl according to the flesh, but the other was born by the free woman through promise.","No alinya omutumwa alazalwa ambili onka, sana olinya awo omulazi ali unu aleozarwa aa ndagano."
205537304,GAL,4,24,"These things may be interpreted as an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. One of them is from Mount Sinai and she bears children into slavery. This is Hagar.","Ebhintu ebhi mbibhasika kugambwa kulabhila omukulengasa, kubha abhalazi habha bhona mbasana endagano ibhili, emo nokuluga omwibhanga lya sinai. Ndizala abhana abhali abhatumwa.

205537305,GAL,4,25,"Now Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia; and she represents the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.","Hati ibhanga Hajili ni ibhanga aheali Abrabuni. Nasaniswa na Yelusalemu, alwo kubha no omufagasi amo na abhana bhe."
205537306,GAL,4,26,"But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.","Sana Yelusalemu eli aigulu elige, nayo niwe mawe weitu."
205537307,GAL,4,27,"For it is written, ""Rejoice, you barren one who does not give birth; cry out and shout for joy, you who are not suffering the pains of childbirth; because the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband.""","Okubha chiandialwe, ""Semelelwa, iwe mukazi engumba, iwe atakuzala.

201330696,2CO,1,8,"For we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the tribulation we had in Asia. We were utterly burdened beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.","Bharumuna bhange, nitwenda kubhamanyisa enaku ezo twabhoine Asia. Tukabhona enaku ezita kugambwa, twayejuma n'omwoyo."
201330697,2CO,1,9,"Indeed, we had the sentence of death on us. But that was to make us not put our trust in ourselves, but instead in God, who raises the dead.","Tukehulira oti bhaturamwire kufs; chonka enaku ezo zikabha zili z'okutwegesa tutesiga mani geitu, sana kwesiga Katonda ahimbura abhafu."

201330703,2CO,1,15,"Because I was confident about this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might receive a second favor.","Echi mbeire ninchimanyage, niyo nsonga mbeire ninyenda kubandiza owanyu kamusemelerwa kusagaho."
201330704,2CO,1,16,"I was planning to visit you on my way to Macedonia.

201330706,2CO,1,18,"But just as God is faithful, our word to you is not ""Yes"" and ""No.""","Obhuso bhwa Katonda omunyamazima, tukabha tutakuhindukana omu bhyo twabhagambiire."
201330707,2CO,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom Silvanus, Timothy, and I proclaimed among you, is not ""Yes"" and ""No."" Instead, he is always ""Yes.""","Yesu Kirisito Omwana wa Katonda, owu Silivano na Timotheo nanyawe twabharangiire akabha atalikuhinduka aha rulimi. 20 Bhuli kanya akabha nagamba echili ch'amazima."
201330708,2CO,1,20,"For all the promises of God are ""Yes"" in him. So also through him we say ""Amen"" to the glory of God.","Nobhona bhyona ebhyo Katonda yarageine, wenene n'iwe abhigobesheleza. Niyo nsonga omu busobhora bwa wenene nitusobhora kugamba tuti, “Amina” kuhaisiliza Katonda."
201330709,2CO,1,21,"Now it is God who confirms us with you in Christ, and he anointed us,","chonka Katonda n'iwe akutugumisa na imwe omuli Kirisito: Akatukora amajuta,"

201330711,2CO,1,23,But I call God as witness to my soul that the reason I did not come to Corinth was so that I might spare you.,"Ninjuliza Katonda, n'iwe akumanya omutima gwange! Okuteija Korinto nkagendelera kubhaganyira imwe."
201330712,2CO,1,24,"This is not because we want to be lords over your faith. Instead, we are fellow laborers with you for your joy, as you stand firm in your faith.","Titulikubhakaka kamwesiga; nitumanya okwu mugumire omu kwesiga.

201334787,2CO,2,3,"I wrote as I did in order that, when I came to you, I might not be hurt by those who should have made me rejoice. I have confidence about all of you that my joy is the same joy you all have.",Niyo nsonga nkabhahandikira ebharua eliya. Nkabhona nteija wanyu abhakumpaire ebhyera bakhaba nibho bansasa.
201334788,2CO,2,4,"For I wrote to you from great tribulation, with anguish of heart, and with many tears. I did not write you so that you would be made sorrowful. Instead, I wanted you to know the depth of the love that I have for you.","Nkabhahandikira obhujune bhundi kubhi, nindira muno. Tinkugendelera kubasasa, sana ninyenda kubhamanyisa obhungi bhw'arukundo  nkubhenda."
201334789,2CO,2,5,"If anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not only to me, but in some measure—not to burden you—to all of you.","K'omuntu arabha akozire ech'okusasa bhanu, tasasize nyawe nyenka. Ntatairemu gungi nakugamba nti na imwe abasasize mwena."
201334790,2CO,2,6,This punishment of that person by the majority is enough.,Omuntu nk'ogwo echibhonabhonyio ech'abhangi bhamuheire nichimumara.
201334791,2CO,2,7,"So now rather than punish him, you should forgive and comfort him. Do this so that he is not overwhelmed by too much sorrow.","Chityo mugwelere mumuganyire kandi mumumaramare, chitali chityo obhujune bhwakushagulirana bhumuchiza amani."
201334792,2CO,2,8,So I exhort you to confirm your love for him.,Nimbatagiliza mumwoleke okwu imwe mukumwenda.

201334794,2CO,2,10,"If you forgive anyone, I forgive that person as well. What I have forgiven—if I have forgiven anything—it is forgiven for your sake in the presence of Christ.","Wena wena owu mukugarulira, nanyawe  nimugarulira.

201334800,2CO,2,16,"To the people who are perishing, it is an aroma from death to death. To the ones being saved, it is an aroma from life to life. Who is worthy of these things?","Abhakwanga kwikiliza nibhaitwa echijunde echikunuka chuchuchu; chonka abhakwesiga, akataachu niko kalikubhaha obhurora."
201334801,2CO,2,17,"For we are not like so many people who sell the word of God for profit. Instead, with purity of motives, we speak in Christ, as we are sent from God, in the sight of God.","Mbwenu aho n'oha akwemera omurimo nk'ogu?

201338883,2CO,3,3,"You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry. It was written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God. It was not written on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.","Imwe muli bharua eyo Kirisito yahandikiire akatutweka. Tehandikisiibwe bhwino, ehandikisize Mwoyo wa katonda asingire.

201338884,2CO,3,4,And this is the confidence that we have through Christ before God.,Oku nikwo kwesiga okwu tulikwesiga Katonda omuli Kirisito.

201338887,2CO,3,7,"Now the ministry of death—engraved in letters on stones—came in such glory that the sons of Israel could not look directly at Moses' face. This is because of the glory of his face, a glory that was fading.","Amateka ageita, agahandikire aha mbengo z'amabhare, garabha gabheire geine echitinwa, Abhaisiraeli bhakalemwa kulebha Musa omu bhuso aha bhw'ensonga y'omwengelero gw'Amateka ago, aho Mwoyo ajiza obhurora tazoke omu chitinwa echishagireho?"

201338893,2CO,3,13,"We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel were not able to look directly at the ending of a glory that was passing away.",Titukusana Musa ayayebhunzire echihundu aha meiso ngu Abhaisiraeli bhataija bhakabhona omwengelero niguhwaho.

201338898,2CO,3,18,"Now all of us, with unveiled faces, see the glory of the Lord.

201342978,2CO,4,2,"Instead, we have rejected secret and shameful ways. We do not walk in craftiness, and we do not mishandle the word of God, but by presenting the truth, we recommend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.","Ebhy'ensoni twabhilekeire, ebhy'okugobheza bhanu titukubhyenda, nangu n'okuhindurana echigambo cha Katonda.

201342980,2CO,4,4,"In their case, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds. As a result, they are not able to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.","Abhakusilika abho, bhahumisiibwe katonda w'ensi eji omu mitima yabho, batasamulirwa vangeli y'echitinwa cha Kirisito, ensuso ya Katonda."

201342982,2CO,4,6,"For God is the one who said, ""Light will shine out of darkness.""

201355271,2CO,7,7,"It was not only by his arrival that God comforted us. It was also by the comfort that Titus had received from you. He told us of your great affection, your sorrow, and your zeal for me. So I rejoiced even more.","tikwija kwa wenene kwonka, chonka mpaho n'okumumaramara okwo mwamumaramazire.

201355273,2CO,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not because you were sorrowful, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. You experienced a godly sorrow, so you suffered no loss because of us.","Nk'okwu bhili, nyawe ninsemelerwa, ti bhwa nsonga ya nyawe kusasa, chonka kubhona mukasasa mwasubha mwayechuza; mukasasa mwagaruka ahali Katonda, aha bhwecho itwe titwabhasasize n'akake."

Worldly sorrow, however, brings about death.","Okusasa mukagaruka ahali Katonda kurugwamu okwechuza; kandi okwechuza kurokora omuntu, mara omuntu takwechuza.

201355278,2CO,7,14,"For if I boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame. On the contrary, just as everything we said to you was true, our boasting about you to Titus proved to be true.","Nkabhebhuga ahali wenene, mara kandi na imwe timunkwese nsoni.

201359362,2CO,8,2,"During a great test of tribulation, the abundance of their joy and the extremity of their poverty have produced great riches of generosity.","Bhakalengwa omu bhiyengo bhingi ebhyo bharabhiremu; chonka bhakasemelerwa muno, bhabha bhafura ebhishobheize, bhajuna bhanu, n'obhwo kaziro bhali bhanaku muno."

201359364,2CO,8,4,they begged us with much earnestness for the privilege of sharing in this service to God's holy people.,Bhakeyendera bhonene bhatutagiliza na bhonene kujuna abhantu bha Katonda omuli Bhuyahudi.

201359366,2CO,8,6,"So we urged Titus, who had already begun this task, to complete among you this act of grace.",Aha bhwecho cho tukatagiliza Tito k'amaliliza omuli imwe  omulimo ogu gw'engonzi nk'okwu yakagubhandize.
201359367,2CO,8,7,"But you abound in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us. So also make sure that you excel in this act of grace.

201359368,2CO,8,8,I say this not as a command but to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the eagerness of other people.,"Omu kugamba ntyo tinkubharagira. Ninyenda kubholeka echika ech'abhandi bhainacho omu kujuna bhanu, mbhone kumanya engonzi zanyu zina mazimaki."
201359369,2CO,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Even though he was rich, for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.","Nimumanya Mukama weitu Yesu Kirisito ech'echisha chamukolize: Wenene akabha ali mutungi, chonka yayehindura munaku kubharokora, mubhone kubha bhatungi aha bhwa wenene kwehindura munaku."

201359372,2CO,8,12,"For if you are eager to do this deed, it is a good and acceptable thing. It must be based on what a person has, not on what he does not have.","Kamurabha nimwenda kubhijira, Katonda arasiima egabho zanyu ezo, nabhona ebhyo mwinabhyo kandi nimusobhora kubhijira, ebhyo mutainabhyo ebhyo tabhiliho."

201359382,2CO,8,22,We are also sending another brother with them. We have tested him in many ways and found him diligent for many tasks.

201359383,2CO,8,23,"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are messengers from the churches. They are a glory to Christ.","Tito ogwo ni mutahi wange; omu kubhakolera n'inyema nawe.

247472135,HEB,2,7,You made man a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor. ,"Omkozile mche omkanya kusaga abhamalaka, wamjweka echitinisa chibhukuru nukukunilwa, wamteka ahaiguru yemilimo yemikono yawe."
247472136,HEB,2,8,"You put everything in subjection under his feet."" For it was to him that God has subjected all things. He did not leave anything not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him.",Wateka ebhintu byona ahansi yebhilenge bhye. Kubhaomkuyeka ebhintu bhona yebhileye tihalasigileho echintu echitatilwe ahansiye. Chonka mbwenu kandititu kalebhile ebhintu byona kutekwa ahansi yawenene.
247472137,HEB,2,9,"But we see him who was made lower than the angels for a little while, Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of his suffering and death, so that by God's grace he might taste death for everyone.","Sana tulebha wenene akakolwa mto omkanya kusaga abha maraika, ogwo, Yesu Kristo, obwensonga yobhusasi, bwohifu, ajwekilwe obhusobhola bwe chitimisa nukukuniles, shsbhobhusobhola bwa Mkama aloze orufu ahabwesonga ya bhuli muntu."
247472138,HEB,2,10,"For it was proper for God, because everything exists for him and through him, to bring many sons to glory. It was proper for him to make the founder of their salvation complete through his sufferings.","Obwensonga chikabha chimsanile wenene kubha ahabwensongaye nummhanda gwe ebhintu bhona bhibhileho, naleta abhana bhangi bhachigobhele echitinisa, kumuhikiliza omwebhembezi Mukulu wobhulokozi bwabho ommhanda gubhusasi."
247472139,HEB,2,11,For both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have one source. So he is not ashamed to call them brothers.,Kubhawenene alikweza nabhona abhalikwezwa nibhaluha ahali omo. Ahabwesonga eji talikwanga kubheta bhalumnabhe.
247472140,HEB,2,12,"He says, ""I will proclaim your name to my brothers, I will sing about you from inside the assembly.""","Akagamba mjakurangilila ibhala iyawe ombhalumna bhange; omgati ye Hanganilo nija kuhoya."""
247472141,HEB,2,13,"And again, ""I will trust in him."" And again, ""See, here am I and the children whom God has given me.""","Mara Kandi, ""Nijakubha nimhndila wenene."" Na kandi, ""Olebhe, inye ndi aha amo nabhana abhimpalwe na Mungu."
247472142,HEB,2,14,"Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he shared in those things in the same way, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil.","Mbwenu, kubha abhana bhanywile obwama' numbhili, wenene nawe atyo akanywa ebho nabhyo, kulambila ommhanda guufufu amwite wenene eyabhale yene amani gu lufu, ogwo ibilisi."
247472143,HEB,2,15,This was so that he would free all those who through fear of death lived all their lives subject to slavery.,Abhasige bhusa bhalinya bhona abhabhale nibhikala omkuteleza orufu bhakabha bhali omubhutole.
247472144,HEB,2,16,"For surely it is not the angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.","Kweli namazima, talikutwala, obhusola bwa Malaika, sana natwala omluzalo lwa Ibrahimu."
247472145,HEB,2,17,"So it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in all ways, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in relation to the things of God, and so that he could make atonement for the sins of the people.","Chityo chisane kusaniswa nabhalumnabhe omubhintu bhona, abhase kubha omweza Mkulu eyane obhuganyizi, omwesigwa omu bhintu bya Mungu, chityo abhase kukola obhulamzi aha ntambala za bhantubhe."
247472146,HEB,2,18,"Because Jesus himself has suffered and was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.","Kubha wenene akasaswa omkulengesibwa, nabhasa kubhabhela bhalinya abhakulengesibwa."
247476225,HEB,3,1,"Therefore, holy brothers, you share in a heavenly calling. Think about Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.","Chityo, abharumna abhalikwela, abhatahibhu kwetwa kumwiguru, mumutekeze Yesu, entumwa mumweza mkulu wukwikiliza kwaitu."
247476226,HEB,3,2,"He was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses was also faithful in all the house of God.","Akabha aliomwesigwa ahakwa Mungu eyamlonzile, nka Musa, Okuyabhale aliomwe sigwa kandi omnju Yona ya Mungu."
247476227,HEB,3,3,"For Jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, because the one who builds a house has more honor than the house itself.","Kubha Yesu yabhalwa kubha owamakune gahango kusaga agoyabhaine yane Musa, kubhaolinya alikwombeka enju nabhalwa kubha namakune gahango kusaga enju yonene."
247476228,HEB,3,4,"For every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God.","Kubha bhulinju niyombeka numuntu, chonka olinya alikwombeka bhulichintu ni Mungu."
247476229,HEB,3,5,"For Moses was faithful as a servant in God's entire house, bearing witness about the things that were to be spoken of in the future.",Mazima Musa akabha yene okwikilizanku mkozi omnju Yona ya Mungu. Akaihayo obhujulizi bhukweleka ebhimbo ebhilagambwa omkanya akalikwija. chonka Kristo nuluzalo lubhulebhelezi bhenju ya Mungu.
247476230,HEB,3,6,But Christ is faithful as a Son who is in charge of the house of God. We are his house if we hold firmly to our courage and the hope of which we boast.,Itwe bwangu omkwesiga nubhusobhola bhukwesiga.
247476231,HEB,3,7,"Therefore, it is just as the Holy Spirit says: ""Today, if you hear his voice","Aha bhecho; Nka moyo alikwela okwa alikugamba,"" Mbwenu, kolahulila ilaka lye,"
247476232,HEB,3,8,"do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the time of testing in the wilderness.","Otakola omtima gwawe kugumisha nka abhaisraeli okubhakozile omtambala, omkanya kukulengeswa omlweya."
247476233,HEB,3,9,"This was when your ancestors rebelled by testing me, after they had seen my deeds for forty years.","Aka kakabha kali akanya oko bhatata bhaitu bhakanfakalila omkundengesa, numkanya, eke emyaka makumi gana, bhakabhona ebhikolwa bhange."
247476234,HEB,3,10,"Therefore I was angry with that generation. I said, 'They have always gone astray in their hearts. They have not known my ways.'","Chityo tindasemelailwe nuluzaho olwo. Nkagamba, 'Nibhabhula bhulikanya om mitimayabho, kandi tibhali kumanya emihandayange."
247476235,HEB,3,11,"It is just as I swore in my wrath: 'They will never enter my rest.'""","Ninka bhulinya okwo nalahile obweechiniga change; tibhali kutaha omubhyela bhange."""
247476236,HEB,3,12,"Be careful, brothers, that none of you has an evil heart of unbelief, a heart that turns away from the living God.","Mbhe abhakomelezi, bhanyaruganda, chityo ataija akabhaho omtima gubhufu ogutalikwesiga aha omo wanyu, omtima ogulabha nigugenda hale amo na Mungu alimlola."
247476237,HEB,3,13,"But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called ""today,"" so that no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.","Kusagaho, mgosolane, bhuli chilo bhuli omo amo nemjenziwe, kubha bhulichilo echili kwetwa mbwenu mwende, kybha omo wanyu omgati yanyu atakolwa kugumangana okubhaiwa nubhufu."
247476238,HEB,3,14,For we have become partners of Christ if we firmly hold to our confidence in him from the beginning to the end.,Kubha obwensonga tubhale abhakwatwa niswe amo na Kristo kutulabha tukwasilege omwesigo gwaitu ommani omli wenene kuluga embandizo kugobha enzindo.
247476239,HEB,3,15,"About this it has been said, ""Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.""","Kubha echitu echi chamazilwe kugambwa ""Chilwechi"" kumlahulila ilakale, mtakola emitima yanu kubha egumangine, nka Abhaesiraeli okwobhakozile akanya akobhufu."""
247476240,HEB,3,16,Who was it who heard God and rebelled? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt through Moses?,Nibhahi abho abhantamilwe Mungu nubhufu? Bhakabha bhatali bhalinya bhona abho Musa akabha nabhaleta kuluga Misiri?
247476241,HEB,3,17,"With whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?","Nabho nibhahi abho Mungu yatamilwe omu miaka makumi gana? Isi tibhamo nabhalinya abhakozile entambala, bhalinya abho emibhuli yabho eyafire ekabyama omlwenya?"
247476242,HEB,3,18,"To whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if it was not to those who disobeyed him?","Nabho ni bhahi abho yalahilile Mungu atitibhalitaha omubhyela, kibhalabha, bhatali bhalinya abhatalabhasize kumkunila wenene?"
247476243,HEB,3,19,We see that they were not able to enter his rest because of unbelief.,Ntulebha tuti tibhalabhasize kutaha omubyela bye obwensonga yokutesiga.
247480321,HEB,4,1,"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest is still allowed to stand, let us fear, so that none of you may seem to have fallen short of it.","Kelabha eliyoendagano yokulaha omumasemerelwa ge, tutine Omoomulimwe, ateija akazoka akajibulwa,"
247480322,HEB,4,2,For we were told the good news just as they were. But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed. ,"Olwokubha namazima, itwe neitwe tulagililwe omumakulu malungi nkabho. Chonka omuchigambo echiulilwe tililabhagasiize abho, olwokubha tililakwatanisa nokwikiliza omunda yabho abhahulile."
247480323,HEB,4,3,"For we who have believed enter that rest, just as he said, ""As I swore in my wrath, They will never enter my rest."" Even so, his works were finished from the foundation of the world.",Itwe abheikilize ntutaba omubyela eliya nkovuyalaganise omuchiniga change tibhalatae ombela byange. Olwokubha ziliyaemilimo zikamalwa omukutekao enyomyo yenu.
247480324,HEB,4,4,"For he has somewhere spoken about the seventh day: ""And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.""","Alwokubha akagamba echilochamusanju, omubandi antu, Tuhanga akaichao echilo cha Musanju akaleka emilimo yawenene yona."""
247480325,HEB,4,5,"And again in this same passage he said, ""They will never enter my rest.""","Naha naho ""Tibhalitaba Omubukama bwange."
247480326,HEB,4,6,"Therefore, it remains for some to enter that rest, and those who previously had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience.",Olwokubha echigambo echo lisigeilengu aliho abantu abho kutaha homu nabhaliya abhalangililwe amakulu gakale bhakabula kutaha olwokubha bhakafakala kwabho.
247480327,HEB,4,7,"So God again appointed a certain day, calling it ""Today,"" when he spoke through David much later in words already quoted: ""Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.""","Yatekao echilofuhindi, kugamba omuli Daudi omubwlbe oguingi, chilechi konkubyegambile kulugha enyuma. chilechi kimulaulile eilaka lyange mutakola emitima yanyu kuguma.

247480328,HEB,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another day.","Nka Joshua kakubhayabhaile ebyela, takujigambile echilo echindi anyuma yaho."
247480329,HEB,4,9,So there remains a Sabbath rest reserved for God's people.,Asigeile echilo chokwichao omubhantu bha katonda.
247480330,HEB,4,10,"For he who enters into God's rest has himself also rested from his deeds, just as God did from his.",Alwokubha oliya ataile omulayela bye ayeichizeo wenene omumilimo ye nka katonda nkokuyeichizeo omumilimo yawenene.
247480331,HEB,4,11,"Therefore let us be eager to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the kind of disobedience that they did.","Tukole mangu kutaha omusemelelwa kweila, ngu omuntu wenene ateije akagwa omukulengeswa nkokuokulolakubhia."
247480332,HEB,4,12,"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.","Alwokubha echigambo cha katonda, lililondicha line namani line nobwoji kuchilao echisyo echikutema oku no kundinyocha nokusatulamu emitima nomwicho, nebhilungo namajuta agali omunda yawenene bhilige kumanya ebhitekateko ebhilyamusima."
247480333,HEB,4,13,"No thing that has been created is hidden before God, but everything is bare and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account.","Talio echintu, ecchitabangulwile omumeisoge, chonka ebhintu byona nibhusa omumeisoge, nebhisululilwe omumeiso wenene aine ebyeitu."
247480334,HEB,4,14,"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us firmly hold to our confession.","Kilabha twine omulanuzi Mukulu eyataile omwigulu, Yesu omwana wa Rahanga tugakwatege amateka geitu."
247480335,HEB,4,15,"For we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses. Rather, we have someone who has in all ways been tempted as we are, except that he is without sin.","Olwokubha taliho omulamuzi Mukulu atalikubhase kutwazangana neitwe ombhintu byobhunefu, alwokubha iliya eyalengeiswe amonetwe ombintu kutali kukola amafu."
247480336,HEB,4,16,"Let us then go with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.","Tulile omuchibhe chemgisha omukuhamya ngu tuhabwe ambabhazi, nokuebwa emigisha yakutuseidia omubyetengo."
247484417,HEB,5,1,"For every high priest, chosen from among people, is appointed to act on the behalf of people in the things concerning God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.","Ahakubha, bhuli omweza mkulu, ayalonzi we kuluga omulimwe, alonzilwe kwemelelela ahalimwe omubhintu ebhikwasileho Mungu, ngu abhase kuleta hamo empongano nezabihu, ahabwamafu."
247484418,HEB,5,2,"He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and who have been deceived, because he himself is subject to weakness.","Nabhasa kwekozesa ahakuhora, nabhafera, nenpakani, ahakubha wenene wenka azungukinue nobhufura."
247484419,HEB,5,3,"Because of this, he also is required to offer sacrifices for his own sins, just as he does for the people's sins.","Ahachekwasoecho, chisaine kuliha empongano ahakubhayamafuge nkokwo akola ahamafu gabhantu."
247484420,HEB,5,4,"No one takes this honor for himself. Rather, he is called by God, just as Aaron was.","Ahachekwasoecho,  chisarie kuliha empongano ahakubahayamafu gabhantu. Kandi taliho omuntu atwala amakune ahabwawenene wenka chonka ahabwa wenene chisaine ayetwe na Mungu - nkokwo yabheile ali - Haruni."
247484421,HEB,5,5,"In the same way, neither did Christ glorify himself by making himself high priest. Instead, the one speaking to him said, ""You are my Son; today I have become your Father.""","Na Kristu talayaheile makune wenene kwekola kubha omweza Mkulu. ahanyuma Mungu akagamba ahaliwenene, ""Iwe oliomwana wange, mbenu nabha so wawe."""
247484422,HEB,5,6,"It is just as he also says in another place, ""You are a priest forever after the manner of Melchizedek.""","Nikwokwo alikugamba, ahandi ati, ""Iwe ni omweza ila neila aha migenzo ya Melkizedeki."""
247484423,HEB,5,7,"During the days of his flesh, Christ offered up both prayers and requests with loud cries and tears to God, the one able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his godly life.","Akauya achali omumubhili, akasabha nokusabhila, akamusabha Mungu namalira. Ahali wenene abhasa kumlokora kuluya omurufu."
247484424,HEB,5,8,"Even though he was a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered.",Aharwokubha akabhayeine okwetoya kwingi ahali Mungu akahulirwa. ahakubha akabha aliomwana akega amakune ahabintu ebyabhaile mbimustaza.
247484425,HEB,5,9,"He was made perfect and became, for everyone who obeys him, the cause of eternal salvation.","Akagobheseleza amihanda eji, chiholwe chiti bulimuntu alamwesiga ajile echekwasu chobhulokozi butaine nekelero."
247484426,HEB,5,10,He was designated by God as high priest after the manner of Melchizedek.,Ahakumubhaghanisa na Mungu nka omweza mkuru ahakauya ka Melkizedeki.
247484427,HEB,5,11,"We have much to say about Jesus, but it is hard to explain since you have become dull in hearing.",Twinebhingi ebyokugamba ahali Yesu chonka nibhiguma kubhasobhorola tuti imwe muli abhanafu bhukuhulira.
247484428,HEB,5,12,"For though by this time you should be teachers, you still have need for someone to teach you the elementary principles of God's messages. You need milk, not solid food!",Chonka ahakanya aka msaine kubha abhegesa kandi alihoumwenzi bwomuntu kubha abhegesa kandi alijhoumwenzi bwomuntu kubheghgesa ebyegeso ebya kale ebyongeso zechiga mbo cha Mungu.

247484429,HEB,5,13,"For anyone who only takes milk is inexperienced with the message of righteousness, because he is still a little child.",Aharwokubha wenawena akunywa amate gonka taine obhumanyi omu makuru gamazima. Ahakubha achali omwana.
247484430,HEB,5,14,"But solid food is for the mature. These are those who, because of their maturity, have their understanding trained for distinguishing good from evil.","Aharubhaju uludi, ebyakula bhigumile ni byabhantu bhakuru, bhalinya ahakubha bhamanyile kumanya Amazima nechibi bhayegesibwe kumanya echibhi nechirungi."
247488513,HEB,6,1,"So then, let us leave the beginning of the message of Christ and move forward to maturity. Let us not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,","Habwecho, khaturaleka hechotwayeghesibwe hambandizo hama kurugha Kristo, tusanirwe kughira hechika chokija kusingha, tutatao nobhundi hebhisigirizo byo kwechiza homumilimo hetaine bhurola na mwe sigho hali Mungu."
247488514,HEB,6,2,"nor the foundation of teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.","Hangha hebhisingirizone rwegheso yo bhubatizwa, hangha kutao hemi kono, hokuhirubhurwa kwa labhafhu, ne hiramulye hirha."
247488515,HEB,6,3,We will also do this if God permits.,Nitwija kukora hebhi Mungu kavitujubhura.
247488516,HEB,6,4,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who were sharers of the Holy Spirit,","Thichi kubhasika halibhalia habha herwe omusana heirha, habharolizeo hobhusobhozi bwa mwighuru, No kukorwa kubha hobhupataniso bwo mwoyo hoghurikwera."
247488517,HEB,6,5,"and who tasted God's good word and the powers of the age to come,",Nabharia habharolize hobhurungi bwe chighambo cha Mungu n Manighakanya hakari kwija.
247488518,HEB,6,6,"but who then fell away—it is impossible to restore them again to repentance. This is because they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and publicly shame him.","Bhaka subha bhagwa - tichikukubha sika kubhagharula bundi homu kwechuzha. Hechinokubha bhamubhambire mwana wa Mungu homurundi gwa kabhiri ne mitima yabho, bhakamukora kybha chintucho kuemura homaisaho ghembagha."
247488519,HEB,6,7,"For the land that drinks in the rain that often comes on it, and that gives birth to the plants useful to those for whom the land was worked—this is the land that receives a blessing from God.","Horwokubha heithaka herikugwamu henjura bhurikanya haighuru, mara hekataho hebirimwa hebhisanile homuribha ria habha kozire hemilimo homwitakha, nibhatorha homubhisa kurugha howa Mungu."
247488520,HEB,6,8,"But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and is near to a curse. Its end is in burning.","Chonka khabhirabha na zarwa hamawa no mwatha, Tirichine bhurungi bwona bwo na rili homu kanya kabhi ko kuramwa. Hezindo yaryo no kwochebwa."

247488522,HEB,6,10,"For God is not unjust. He will not forget your work and the love you showed for his name, because you served his holy people, and you are still serving them.","Horwo kubha Mungu timuntu wa kwebwa hatahira kahijukho hamilimo yanyu na ngonzizanyu heyomwamworekire horwe songha ye bhararye, haryechi, mkabhakorela habhasomeswa na hati muchaghenderela kubhakorela."

247488525,HEB,6,13,"For when God made his promise to Abraham, he swore by himself, since he could not swear by anyone greater.","Hobwesonga Mungu hobwoya muhere hedaghano, hakaraghara horwo mwoyo gwe, Takubhasizhe kulya chirapo hamuntu hondiyo hakumusagha hobhukuru."

247488530,HEB,6,18,"He did this so that by two unchangeable things—with which it is impossible for God to lie—we, who have fled for refuge, will have a strong encouragement to hold firmly to the hope set before us.","Akakora hatyo habhintubhibiri hebhitabhasa kulinduka, homukye byo Mungu tabhasa kighamba bisubha; hitwe habhairukire hobwikaro tubhase kuhebwa homwoyo gwo kikwata amani gwo kwesigha hechiteirwe homu maiso ghaitu."

And resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.","Tene ile, teine nyina, tein bhazaile, tine mbandizo ye echilo na tene obhulekelelo bwe okwikala kwe. Sasa, neikala kubha omwana wa ila loyona, nka omwana wa Mungu."
247492612,HEB,7,4,See how great this man was to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the things that he had taken in battle.,Mbwenu otekeleze ogu omuntu okwali muhango. Omuzeile weitu Abrahamu akamua emo omwilami ye ebhintu ebhilungi ebhiyeile ombita.
247492613,HEB,7,5,"The descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a command according to the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, even though they, too, are descended from Abraham.","Na nikwo, oluganda lwa abhalawi abhalavasi le eofisi zo abheza bhakabhabhei ne ejubhulo kulunga omiango kulundu na emo yeikumi kuluga omubhantua, aho, kuluga omba isilaeli bhatai bhabho, kwiyamu nabhonene, nalubhalalwa bhabhei le bhali oluganda lwabha Abrahamu."
247492614,HEB,7,6,"But Melchizedek, whose descent was not traced from them, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him, the one who had the promises.","Chonka Melkizedeki, eyabheile atalilugandalwa abhalawi, akalwata emo yekumu kuluga alawa Abrahamu, akamuha, wenene akabha yeihe endagano."
247492615,HEB,7,7,There is no denying that the lesser person is blessed by the greater person.,Aho fichikwanywa omuntu muto kugabhilwe no omuango.
247492616,HEB,7,8,"In this case, mortal men receive tithes, but in that case, it is testified that he lives on.","Awechintu echo omuntu alalavata emo ye ikumi naiga echilochimo, chonka echintu echindi chimwayakuasile emoyeikumi kuluga owa abtahamu chikeyelela obi yene  obhulola."
247492617,HEB,7,9,"And, in a manner of speaking, Levi, who received tithes, also paid tithes through Abraham,","No omukugamba, Lawi eyalawasile emo ye ikumi nawe akalipa akwa Abrahamu,"
247492618,HEB,7,10,because Levi was in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.,Okubha Lawi akabha ali omunda ya tataye Abrahamu omukanya ka Melkizedeki olwoyatangai mwe na Abrahamu.
247492619,HEB,7,11,"Now if perfection were possible through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the manner of Melchizedek, and not be considered to be after the manner of Aaron?","Mbwenu okwegobheseloza kikulabhalava bheileo kulabhile amweza wa lawi, (aho ahansi ye alio abhakulavata emihango), akabhaaho chi echindi ali omweza ondijo kwimuchwa obhutwazi bwa Mwlkizedeki, na tikuetwa okwoyalabhileo Haruni?"
247492620,HEB,7,12,"For when the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed.","Mbwenu obwoza kibhulaindurwa, alio ensongayo okundula emihango."
247492621,HEB,7,13,"For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.","Nko omo ebhintu ebhi ebyagambilwe alulimi olundi, kuluga alaowenene taho eyatimikile alilwensinga."
247492622,HEB,7,14,"Now clearly it is from Judah that our Lord was born, a tribe that Moses never mentioned concerning priests.","Nchimanyika okwo omukama weitu akuluga Yuda, niyo eleabila ya Musa atalagambile kuusu abheza."
247492623,HEB,7,15,What we say is even clearer when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek.,Ne ebhi ebhitukugamba mbyemanyisa kubhatalio omwoza alizoka omulenjo gwa Melikizedeki.
247492624,HEB,7,16,"This one became a priest, not based on a law of physical requirement, but by the power of an everlasting life.","Omwoza ogu owa hati fo omo obeile omweza aiguru ye emiisingi ye emango ekulewatana  na oleozalo lwa abhantu, chonka omisingi ya amani eya amaisha agatakubhasa kufa kubhi."
247492625,HEB,7,17,"For scripture witnesses about him: ""You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.""","Omulyecho ebhiandikilwe mbijuliza wenene, oli Melkizedeki."""
247492626,HEB,7,18,For not only has the former command been set aside because it is weak and useless—,Kubha emango eyalabhileo ekatekwa alubhaju okubha ekabha etegobheseleze na ekabha etakutufaa.
247492627,HEB,7,19,"for the law made nothing perfect—but also a better hope is introduced, through which we come near to God.","Emiaryo eju ekaha etalakkukola chonachona echigobhile. Sana, akabha aliyo obhumaza bhulunji hao fukabha twililile katonda."
247492628,HEB,7,20,"And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,","No obhumaza obhu bhulungi tibhulakozilwe atali kugambe omukwelaila, omuliechi abhoza abhandi tibhalayelaile chonachona."
247492629,HEB,7,21,"but he became a priest with an oath by the one who said to him, ""The Lord has sworn and he will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'""","Chonka Mungu akatwala olwelamula olwoyaga mbile ali yesu, ""Mukama alamwile takuindura ebhitekelezo bye: iwe di omwoza neila lyona."""
247492630,HEB,7,22,By this also Jesus has given the guarantee of a better covenant.,Omuli echi Yesu yeizile kubha omuzamana ogulungi.
247492631,HEB,7,23,"The former priests were many in number, since death prevented them from continuing in office.","Omumazima, olufu ndutanga abheza kwegesa neita tyona., nokubha akabhaalio abheza bheingi, omo aondijo."
247492632,HEB,7,24,"But because Jesus continues to live forever, he has a permanent priesthood.","Kubha Yesu nowa bhulchilo, Obwoza bwetibhuluba dilika."
247492633,HEB,7,25,"Therefore he is also able to save completely those who approach God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.","Wenene nabhasa omukugobhesleza kulokola abhali ehei na Mukama kulabhila alimwenene, kubhawenene no oweila nokutusabhila."
247492634,HEB,7,26,"For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, who is holy, innocent, pure, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.","Omwoza mukulu moogu nasobhola kubha ali owaitu. ateine ebhikolwa bhibhi, kabhi, alikweyonja, oubhafegile kuluga ombibhi, na ali aigulu kusaga o igulu."
247492635,HEB,7,27,"He does not need, unlike the high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He did this once for all when he offered himself.","Wenene akabha atati wa kweyenda, okwelenga omwoza Mukama, akabha agabha bhulichilo, ombikolwa bhibhi bya wenene, okumala akwewenenenagabha na alwa ebhibhibye. akakola lumo alwa bhona, olwoyayegabhile wenene."
247492636,HEB,7,28,"For the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses. But the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed a Son, who has been made perfect forever.","Omiangoye nachagua abhantu abhafakwebhasa omubhoza abhakulu, chonka omuchigambocho okwela mula, elyeizile omiango ye, akamutao omwana, eyakozilwe kubha omwegobheseleza we ila byona."
247496705,HEB,8,1,Now the point of what we are saying is this: We have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.,Olyecho oobyotulikugamba okigambo kikuru nicho echi twine omweza omukura owe Eshonga egi. Ashutamile omukono ogwa Bulyo na ahakitebe okyo obumazi bhukuru omwingulu.
247496706,HEB,8,2,"He is a servant in the holy place, the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up.","Omukozi ohalikwela na omuhema elya amazima, olyo omukama yataileo alitalimuntu."
247496707,HEB,8,3,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary to have something to offer.,"Olwenshonga bhuli mweza omukuru atebwaho abose kwihayo obubase bwe epongano, olwecho nawe asanile kuba aine kyona kyona  okyokweho ngela."
247496708,HEB,8,4,"Now if Christ were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the law.",Kayakubeile aliahaingulu ye ensi tiyakubheile omwza. Olweshonga aliho abaihayo ebhigemulo ke ebhilagiro bye Emuku.
247496709,HEB,8,5,"They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. It is just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to construct the tabernacle: God said, ""See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.""","Abhakozi abhashana na ekichuchu che ebihtu Ebyo omwingulu, iha Musa okwo yaligilwe na katonda ko kwo yabayetekateka kukola ihema lilinya, niyo nsgonga akagamba. Olebe okole ebitu byona ko olushusho lulinya olwoyayolekilwe Halinya ahaibanga."
247496710,HEB,8,6,"But now Christ has received a much better ministry, just as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which is based on better promises.","Chonka bwenu akahabwa omulimo oguligulungi kushanga ko kwo yabaile etumwa we endagano elinungi, ayalamwile ahaingulu ye endangano ezilizilungi."
247496711,HEB,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, no occasion for a second would have been sought.","Niyo eshonga kilinya ekye ebanolizo kikaba kitene ekilikubulako, omumwanya tikyakwihilweho ahahkilinya ekya kabili."
247496712,HEB,8,8,"For when God found fault with the people, he said, ""See, the days are coming—says the Lord— when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.","Chonka katonda, kayabhekanasize abhatubhe na ibilo mbija anagamba Mukama. Naye nibhagobheshleza enju ya Israel na enju ya Yuda endagono eshya."
247496713,HEB,8,9,"It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day that I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not carefully obey my covenant, and I disregarded them— says the Lord.","Tilishoboka kuba endagano ayo ya lagaine na bheishe bhabho, omukilo kilinya okyoyabakwasile emukono yabo abaiheyo omunsi ya Misiri. Niyo eshonga Tibhaikeile omundagano yange, niyo eshonga inye tinabaiteleho nagamba Mukama."
247496714,HEB,8,10,"This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws into their minds, and I will also write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.","Niyoshonga endagano oyondalagana na enju abaisrael kuluga ahabhi lo bhilinya nagaba Mukama. 'ninyija kubhaha obhilagiro bhage, omukwetekateka omu mitiya yabo ninyijakubihandika nanye naba. Katonda ulibonene, na bonene bhalabha abhantu bhange."
247496715,HEB,8,11,"They will not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord.' For they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.","Nabo tibhalikwija kwegesana bhuli omo na murataniwe, na bhuli omo na mulumunawe, kumugambhila amanye Mukama, niyo eshonga bhona abhamanya, kubhandiza ahamuto wabo na mukulu wabho."""
247496716,HEB,8,12,"For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will not remember any longer.""","Olwecho ndabhaganyile abhibhi bhabo na entambhala zabo tindikwija kuzijuka, kindi."""
247496717,HEB,8,13,"By calling this covenant ""new,"" he declared the first covenant to be obsolete, and what has become obsolete and old will soon disappear.","Nikwo kugamba endagano eshya agikozile elinya eya embandizo kebha ayakuzile, chonka ekintu kakibhanza kukula no kuhagala kiba . Kilihei kuhwaho."
247500801,HEB,9,1,Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.,Mbwenu ne ndagano eyokubhanza ekabha yeine Akauya kokwegasaniza aha omunsi nenikulele yokwegashaniza.
247500802,HEB,9,2,"For a tabernacle was prepared. The first room, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the presence, was called the holy place.","Kubha omwihema akabha halimu echisika chite katekiwe echisika cha aheru, chikabha hali ahalikwera, ahamwanya ogu hakabha haliho omunara gwo rumuli, emeza nemigate yo kweleka."
247500803,HEB,9,3,"Behind the second curtain was another room in the tabernacle, called the most holy place.","Nenyuma yo rutimbe olwakabhili hakabha haliho echimba echindi, haketwa ahantu ahakwera muno."
247500804,HEB,9,4,"It had a golden altar for incense. It also had the ark of the covenant, which was completely overlaid with gold. Inside it was a golden jar that held the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.","Hakabha halimu orotale ye dhahabhu yo kutaho obhubhani. Ahandi akabha haliho ne sanduka ye ndagano, eyabhaile eyo mbekise edhahabhu yonka. Omundo yayo hakabha halimu ebhakuri ye dhahabhu yeine engeli, ye nkoni ya Haruni eyamezile emba bhi/ebhishaka. na zilinya embao z amabhale ze ndagano."
247500805,HEB,9,5,"Above the ark of the covenant, glorious cherubim overshadowed the atonement lid, which we cannot now talk about in detail.",Ahaiguru ye sanduka ye ndagano. Emitondele ya maserafi yo bhulikwera nibhubhandikira amapapa gabho omumaisho ge chitebhe chokubhateranisa. Ahalyecho mbwenu titubhasa kuchigamba ho muno.
247500806,HEB,9,6,"After these things were prepared, the priests always entered the outer room of the tabernacle to perform their services.",Ahanyuma yebhintu ebhikubha bhitekateki rwe ne entumwa ahakutaha ahachiyumbha cha aheru rutimbe kukora emilimo yabho.
247500807,HEB,9,7,"But only the high priest entered the second room, once each year, and not without blood that he offered for himself and for the people's unintentional sins.","Chonka omutumwa omo mukuru ataha omuchi yumba cha kabhili chonka omurundi gumo omu mwaka, na atalekile kutaho echigemulo aharwa wenyine nyabwe na habhibhi bya bha ntu ebyobhakoze bhatamanyile."
247500808,HEB,9,8,"The Holy Spirit showed that as long as the first tabernacle was still standing, the way into the most holy place had not yet appeared.","Mwoyo alikwera nabhamanyisa okwo, omuhanda gwa hantu halikwera muno tihakashu ruliwe orwokubha ihema lyambele lichali ho lyemeleile."
247500809,HEB,9,9,This was an illustration for the present time. Both the gifts and sacrifices that are now being offered are not able to perfect the worshiper's conscience.,"Echi ni chelekano chomwanya ogu ogwa hati, byona emperwa ne chigemulo ebyahairwe hati tibhibhasa kumara chigendelero chomuntu alikushabha."
247500810,HEB,9,10,"They are only concerned with food and drink and various ceremonial washings, regulations for the body until the time of the new order.","Nebhyokulya ne bhyokunywa byonka, bhite laniswe omungeli yukwetekatekera omwegeshanize yo kweyoja, bhyona ebhi bhikabha bhili entekateka ye bhyomubhili elyabhaile bhitekatekirwe kugobha kweja kwe omuhango ogusya elata ahantu hayo."
247500811,HEB,9,11,"Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come. He went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands, one not belonging to this created world. ","Kiristo akaija nkentumwa enkuru we bhigambo ebhirungi ebhaizijura kwi ihema elihango, elitakakozirwe mikono yabhantu. Abhatali obhomunsi eji eyatonzirwe."
247500812,HEB,9,12,"It was not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood that he entered into the most holy place once for all and secured our eternal redemption.","Ekabha etali arwo bhwamba bwe mbuzi ne enyana, shana abhabwambabwe ngu Kiristo akataha ahantu ahalikwera muno rumo hamuntu omo nokutugambira no kutumanyisa oburokozi bwaitu elanaela."
247500813,HEB,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of a heifer's ashes on those who have been defiled sanctifies them for the cleansing of their flesh,",Kibhilabha ahabwamba bwembuzi no bhusobhora bwokushesherwa kwiju lye enyana ahalyezo ezitali zirungi ezayangirwe na hali katonda no kukola emibhili yabho kubhamirungi.
247500814,HEB,9,14,"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?","Isi timuno munonga obwamba bwa Kiristo owo kulabhira mwoyo wa ilanaila akehayo wenene kutali kwebhaza ahali katonda, kwoja echi gendelero chaitu kuluga omubhikorwa ebhibhi kukoelera katonda alikurola."
247500815,HEB,9,15,"For this reason, he is the mediator of a new covenant. This is so that, since a death has taken place to redeem those under the first covenant from their transgressions, those who are called will receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.","Orwenshonga ejo, Kiristo ne ntumwa ye ndgano ensya. echi nicho nshonga orufu rukabha leka mwayetwara mwena abhali omundagano eyambele kulugha omuntambara zibhibhi byabho ngu chimanyike okwo bhona abhayesirwe katonda bhabhase kubhona obusika bwabho eilanaila."
247500816,HEB,9,16,"For where there is a will, the death of the person who made it must be proven.","Kaharabha haliho endagano yokwikaraho, chisaine chimanyike nko orufu rwomuntu olinya elyoyakozile."
247500817,HEB,9,17,"For a will is only valid when there has been a death, because it has no force while the one who made it is still alive.",Kubha endagano yeine amani ahantu hakuzoka orufu. Orwenshonga taliho mani akanya kongwo alikubhikora acha rola.
247500818,HEB,9,18,So not even the first covenant was established without blood.,Orwecho tichilinya che ndagano eya mbele chikabha chiteirweho chitali cha bwamba.
247500819,HEB,9,19,"For when Moses had given every command in the law to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water, red wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people.","Orwo Musa yabhaile ataileho bhuli kulagira ahamuku ahabhantu bhona akakwata obwamba  bwente nembuzi, hamo na amaizi, echitambara chilikuttukura, ne hisopo na kusheshera ekitabho echine abhantu bhona."
247500820,HEB,9,20,"Then he said, ""This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.""","Yashubha yagamba, ""Obhu no bwamba bwenda gano eyo katonda yabhahaile omuhango wanyu."
247500821,HEB,9,21,"In the same manner, he sprinkled the blood on the tabernacle and all the containers used in the ministry.",Omulyechi akanya konenekonne akasheshera obhwamba ahaiguru yi ihema ne bhikozeso byona ebyakoziswe ahamirimo ye entumwa.
247500822,HEB,9,22,"According to the law, almost everything is cleansed with blood. Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.","No kuhondera ngano no muku, ni chizo ka bhuli chintu chikezibwa no bwamba. Katali kusesa obwamba taliho okuganyirwa."
247500823,HEB,9,23,"Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices. However, the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed with much better sacrifices.","Orwecho chikabha chili chintu chokugimba ngu okwijuchwa ebhintu byomwiguru, bhisaine bhishemezwe ahachigemuro echili chirungi munoye nyamaishwa, norwecho, ebhintu ebyahaiguru byonene nibhibhasibhwa kusheme zzwa ne chigemulo echili chirungi muno."
247500824,HEB,9,24,"For Christ did not enter into the most holy place made with hands, which is only a copy of the true one. Rather, he entered into heaven itself, to appear now in God's presence for us.","Kubha Kiristo talatahile ahantu ahalikwera. muno ahakozirwe ne mikono eyabhaile no kwijuchwaokwe chintu echili chonene. Ahanyuma yaho akataha omwiguru wenene, ahantu hati ahali omumaiso ga katonda orwe nshonga yaitu."
247500825,HEB,9,25,"He did not go there in order to offer himself many times, as does the high priest, who enters the most holy place year by year with the blood of another.","Talatahile kulinya aharwenshonga yokwe ihayo empongano orwenshonya ya wenene okwa kora entumwa enkuru, etaha ahantu ahalikwera muno omwaka ne ha mwaka hamo no bwamba bwo ndijo."
247500826,HEB,9,26,"If that had been the case, then he would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.","Nkecho gakabha amazima, chakubhaile ahali wenene kusaswa omirundi mingi muno kuluga embandizo ye ensi, chonka mbwenu norwambele no rwenzindo aha myaka eyoyayeyolekile kwihao echibhi aha rwichigemulo chawenene wenene."
247500827,HEB,9,27,"Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that comes judgment,","Nkolwo chili ahabhuli muntu kufa, nangu na halyecho kwija karamurwa,"
247500828,HEB,9,28,"so also, Christ was offered once to take away the sins of many, and will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but for the salvation of those who are waiting for him.","nikwo bhili Kiristo okwo yaihirweyo rumo kwihaho ebhibhi byabhaingi. Akabhonekerwa orwababhili, tinshonga yokubhera abhebhibhi shana omubhurokozi ahali bhalinya abhamulindilile omukusasa."
247504897,HEB,10,1,"For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the real forms of those things themselves. Those who approach God can never be made perfect by the same sacrifices that the priests continually bring year after year.",Olukubha omuku nichibhunda che ebhintu ebhirungi ebhihija. Tibhilinya ebhulikwo. Omuku gwonene tigubhasa kugobaselezaabhuililila katonda omu kutoora empongano zonenezonene eza abheza bagendeleile kuhayo buli mwaka.
247504898,HEB,10,2,"Otherwise, would the sacrifices not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed one time and would no longer have any consciousness of sin.","Kichitali chityo ebhitambo tibya kulekeile kutambwa? kubha abhegasaniza, kibhakumazibwa limo lyonka tibhakubheile bachayemanya ho butakare."
247504899,HEB,10,3,But with those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.,Chonka omubhitambo ebyo alimuakeijieko kamafu ezakozilwe buli mwaka.
247504900,HEB,10,4,For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.,Olukubha tichibhasika obwamba bwenimi nembuzi kwiyaho mafu.
247504901,HEB,10,5,"When Christ came into the world, he said, ""Sacrifices and offerings you did not desire, but a body you have prepared for me;","Olukubha Kristo kiyeizile omunsi agambati timulayenzile bitambo anga mpongano, sana mkantekela omubhili."
247504902,HEB,10,6,with burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not take pleasure.,Tolasemeile bhitambo ebhiwele kelezibwe nempongano ahalwe ntambara.

247504904,HEB,10,8,"First he said, ""It was neither sacrifices, nor offerings, nor whole burnt offerings, nor sin offerings that you desired. Nor did you take pleasure in them."" These are sacrifices that are offered according to the law.",Aho mbele agaba ati ebitambo nempongano ebhiweleke lezibwe timwalabyenzile timwala bhisemeleilwe ahabwentambara ebhibhahayo nku omuku okuguli.

Omukwegendeleza okwa kabhili"
247504906,HEB,10,10,"By that will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.",Omukama katonda akatwi yayo ahabwengonzize akahayo omubhili gwa ebhilo byona.

247513090,HEB,12,2,"Let us pay attention to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of the faith. For the joy that was placed before him, he endured the cross, despised its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.","Tuteke amaisogaitu aliYesu ogwo oyabhandise kadi alikuhiliza emwesiyo yetu, alwamasheane lelwa,agatailue omumashoge, akegumisilizi amusalabha, yayegaya esomize, kandi yasunmfama haansi amukono gwabhulyo bhivichitable cha choghukama, bhwakatenda."

247513095,HEB,12,7,Endure suffering as discipline. God deals with you as with sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?,"Tindikugobhwo naku nkukusubhamo. Katonda na naviya itwe nkaokwalikwiga abhana, orukubha ninwanchi iese atabhasa kumhana?"
247513096,HEB,12,8,"But if you are without discipline, which all people share in, then you are illegitimate and not his sons.","Chanko karabha, atelio muhmo, alukubha itwetwena bhitukwasileho, basi imwe muramilwe muramilwe kandi etimnlibhanabhe."
247513097,HEB,12,9,"Furthermore, we had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!","Omuliebhobhona, tukabhatwine tata baitu abhomusi omwabhabhaila nibhatuhana kandinibhatukwira. Chtyo tichitusmire, kukuira tata wamwoyo  alikwera kandi tukatwa?"
247513098,HEB,12,10,"Our fathers disciplined us for a short time as they thought best. But God disciplines us for our benefit, so that we can share in his holiness.","Amazima abhazila bhaitu, bhakatutera omumiaka mike, nkaokwochazokile alibhoneni. Chonka kantonda, naturamira, alikutunda kurungi, tubhaso kukwasanya obhulikwelabhwe."
247513099,HEB,12,11,"No discipline at the time seems to give joy, but to give sorrow. But later it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who have been trained by it.","Taliho hiramu elilikusemeloza, akanya ako, nihabha aliho obhusasi. Chonka kandi anyuma niazarwa, echirabha cheenilembe, chowetoya alibhaliya abhayegesibhwe."
247513100,HEB,12,12,So strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees.,"Chityo simucha emikono yangu, iliyolemena, kandi Nekukora, ebhiju bhanyu ebhine okunamna kubha amani emuli wenene."
247513101,HEB,12,13,"Make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be sprained but rather be healed.","Imucha emihanda yangu nebblenjo bhwayu ngu, wenawena alemanle, talikuja kutwalwa, omukubhura zana abhase kuchizibwa,"

197189656,1CO,14,24,"But if you all were prophesying and an unbeliever or an outsider came in, he would be convicted by all he hears. He would be judged by all that is said.","Chonka kumlabha mwena nimwihayo obhulangi atakesigile nanga omchazi akatahamu, najakubhawabhawa na bhilinya bhona ebhakuhulila.

He would declare that God is really among you.","Enama yumtimagwe, nejakukomololwa okubhoneka kwa wenene, akagwile ajumale mukumlamya Mungu. akakilize lati Mungu ali ongati yanyu."
197189658,1CO,14,26,"What is next then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Do everything so that you build up the church.","Ni chihi echikundelaho aho, bhakulu bhange amo nabhanyazi bhange?

222306314,1TH,2,10,"You are witnesses, and God also, how holy, righteous, and blameless was our behavior toward you who believe.","Imwe muli abhajulizi hamo na katonda, kujuvila ahalimwe abhesiga kujulila emitambukile yeitu okuyabheile neyera eteina kabhajooka."
222306315,1TH,2,11,"In the same way you know how we were with each one of you, as a father with his own children,",Kubha nimumanya okutwajizile buly'omo omulimwe nkeise wa bhaana okwamalamala abhanabhe. Tukajueila
222306316,1TH,2,12,"exhorting you and comforting you and urging you to walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.",mkasanilwa kutambuka nk'a omweto gwanyu okugwabheile guli ahali katonda ayabhesile omubhukama ne echitiimwache.
222306317,1TH,2,13,"For this reason we also thank God constantly, that when you received God's message that you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of man, but just as it truly is, the word of God, which is also at work in you who believe.","Nitusima Mukama katonda bhueikaanya obhutalekera, olwokubha kimwayakiile echigambo cha katonda echimwahulire kuvuga ahalitwe. timulachakile nki echigambo chabhantu sana mkachakila echigambo cha katonda okwa amazima gali. nechigambo echikora emilimo omuliimwe abhesiga."
222306318,1TH,2,14,"For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they did from the Jews",Kubha imwebhavumuma bhange mkavondora amakanisa ga katonda agali omuli Kristo Yesu agali omuli Buyudi. Mkasasiibwa omubhigambo byonene ebyo kuvuga omubhantu bhanyu.
222306319,1TH,2,15,"who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and who drove us out. They do not please God. Instead, they are hostile to all people.",Na abhayahudi abheisile omukama Yesu na abharangi. Abhayahudi nibho bhatubhingire bhahatusooza ahevu. Tibhasemelela katonda kaelo nabhabhisa babhantu boona.
222306320,1TH,2,16,They forbid us to speak to the Gentiles for them to be saved. The result is that they always fill up their sins to the limit. But wrath will overtake them in the end.,"Bakatutanga tutagambila bhanyamahanga kujunwa, nabwo beijuza bhatyo echilengo cha amafu gaabo obhutosa. Enzindo echiniga cheija kubhahwelekeleza."
222306321,1TH,2,17,"But we, brothers, were separated from you for a short time, in person not in heart. We were especially eager, with great desire, to see your faces.",Bhavumuna bhange Itwe tukatanisibwa neimwe akaanya kake anamubhiniti mumwoyo. Tukakora ahalwobhu bhasa bweitu nechinika chinhango mumo. tubhase kubhona obhuso bwaanyu.
222306322,1TH,2,18,"For we wished to come to you—indeed I, Paul, once and again—but Satan stopped us.",Nicho twayendeile kwiija owanyu nyawe Paulo ti lumo iwonka nomulundi gwa kabuili. Chonka setani yatutanga.
222306323,1TH,2,19,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of pride in front of our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?","Isi okwesiga kweitu niki ahanzindo n'amasemelelelwa, anga ekaeinda y'o kwevugisa omumeiso ga Mukamka weitu Yesu kaligamka. Isi timuse kushaaga nka abhandi okwobhali?"
222306324,1TH,2,20,For you are our glory and joy.,Olwokubha Imwe nimwe chitiimwa na amasemelelwa geitu.
222310401,1TH,3,1,"Therefore, when we could no longer bear it, we thought it was good to be left behind at Athens alone.","Obhutwabheire tutakubhassa kuegumi siliza muno, tukabha ntutekeleza tuti nichirungi kuikora tuenka athene."
222310402,1TH,3,2,"We sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and comfort you regarding your faith, ","Tukatweka murumuna weitu Timoteo outuhereza hamo katonda omu vangeri ya Kristo, abagumize, abamaramare omukwesiga kwanyu."
222310403,1TH,3,3,so that no one would be shaken by these tribulations. For you yourselves know that for this we have been appointed.,"Tukakora rbyo atakurugaho eya kutengesibwa omunaku ezi, kubhaimwe mmumanya oku echo nicho tunayeteirwe."
222310404,1TH,3,4,"Truly, when we were with you, we told you in advance that we were about to suffer affliction, and it happened just so, as you know.","Mazima obutuabeire tubeine tukabanza tuabagambila okutuli hei kusasibwa, okumukumanya bhikabhaho."
222310405,1TH,3,5,"For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent that I might know about your faith. Perhaps the tempter had somehow tempted you, and our labor was in vain.","Esonga obubabeire ntakubhaso kwe gumisiliza, nkatueka mbase kumanya omwesigo gwangu. Nti omulengesa yabhalengesize, numulimo gweita gukafa busa."
222310406,1TH,3,6,"But Timothy came to us from you and brought us the good news of your faith and love. He told us that you always have good memories of us, and that you long to see us just as we also long to see you.",Chonka Timoteo akeija oweitu naruga owanyu akatuletera amakuru garungi gu mwesigo nengo nzi zanyu. Akatugambira okumukutwi jukage. nukumukwegomba kutubona nkeitue okutukwegomba kubhabhona.
222310407,1TH,3,7,"Because of this, brothers, we were comforted by you because of your faith, in all our distress and affliction.","Orwecho bhavumuna bhange, tukahumuzvi zibwa neimwe orumwesigo gwanyu omunaku nubusasi bweitu bwana."
222310408,1TH,3,8,"For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.",Mbwenu nturola kimulaba mugumile omumukama.
222310409,1TH,3,9,"For what thanks can we give to God for you, for all the joy that we have before our God over you?","Rusimoki orutubasa kusimila katonda aharwangu, aharwamasemererwa gona agutubheinire omumeiso ga katonda?"
222310410,1TH,3,10,Night and day we pray very hard that we may see your face and provide what is lacking in your faith.,Ntusaba muro omuchiro na bwamusana tubase kubona obuso bwanyu nuku bongeza ho echimukuburwa omumwesigo gwanyu.
222310411,1TH,3,11,"May our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you.","Katonda weitu tata wenene, na mukama weitu Yesu atweleke omuhanda gweitu tugobhe owanyu."
222310412,1TH,3,12,"May the Lord make you increase and abound in love one for another and toward all people, as we also do for you.","Omukama abongerecho engozi, mugonzanga ne nukugonza abhantu bhona, nkukutuku bakolela imwe."
222310413,1TH,3,13,May he strengthen your hearts so that they will be blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy people.,"Abone kugumisa emitima yanyu esangwe eteine karongomo omubulikuela omumeiso ga katonda weitu, neiseitwe omukuija kumukama Yesu hamo nabhalikwembe bhona."
222314497,1TH,4,1,"Finally, brothers, we earnestly appeal to you and exhort you in the Lord Jesus. As you received instructions from us about how you must walk and please God, also in this way walk, so that you do so even more.","Imwe barumna, nitubhungeramu esubhi amwoyo, bmuli Yesu Kristo. kukumwakwasili, ebhilagilo kulunga akitwe, okuchisanie kugundelele, nekwenda katonda, omulecho, mugendelele kukola muvo."
222314498,1TH,4,2,For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.,"Olukubha, nimumanya nibhilaguloki, abhitwakwasile kulabhila, omuli Yesu Kristo."
222314499,1TH,4,3,"For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you avoid sexual immorality,","Olukubha, hebhi, nibhikorwa bhwa katendo: Oknezwa mwetantale, ebhibhi,"
222314500,1TH,4,4,"that each of you knows how to possess his own vessel in holiness and honor,","okubha bhulimuntu, omulimwe, namanya engeli eyalikutuzamu, mukaziwe, oomubhulikwela, hamo namakwe."
222314501,1TH,4,5,not in the passion of lust (as the Gentiles who do not know God).,"Otjira mukazi alukwengomba, kwemubhili (kabhanyahamnga abhatalikumanya, Katonda)."
222314502,1TH,4,6,"Let no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we forewarned you and testified.","Atabhaho muntu wenawena, alaanga amupakigwe, akachokoza, Mulumunanee alichi: Olukubha katonda niaie alikujira euugu, omulibhuli kaitu. Okoku'o twabhebhemle, omukubhana hamo, nokubhasulurira."
222314503,1TH,4,7,"For God did not call us to uncleanness, but to holiness.","Olukubha, katonda talatwesire, omuziro, sana, omubhulikwera."
222314504,1TH,4,8,"Therefore, he who rejects this rejects not people, but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.","Chityo akwanga hechi talikewanga bhatu, suna nayaya katonda. Alikughabha, mwoyo alikwera."
222314505,1TH,4,9,"Regarding brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.","Abhikwataine engozi zobhuluama, talio nsongo yona yona yomtu kukuandikuila. Olubha, mwegesibhwe na katonda kwendangana, simwe."
222314506,1TH,4,10,"Indeed, you do this for all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, to do this even more.","Mazima mukakola ebhi bhona, omubhuluama, abhali Makedonia yona, chonka, nitubhasabu, abharumuna, mukole mutyo muno."
222314507,1TH,4,11,"We also exhort you to aspire to live quietly, take care of your own responsibilities, and labor with your hands, just as we commanded you,","Nitubhasabha mwegombe kuikara , nobhura , obhutaikeine, mwenda emilimo yanyu, kandi kukora eblilimo omumikono yanyu, nkokurotwabhagambire"
222314508,1TH,4,12,so that you may walk properly before outsiders and not be in any need.,"Kole ebhi abase, kwikarage, omumakune haki habho abhali aheru, yemwesigo, mutaija mukabhulwa, kantu konakona."
222314509,1TH,4,13,"We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who sleep, so that you do not grieve like the rest, who do not have hope.","Titukwenda jimwe, mumanye okwobhitali imwe abhalumuna hali habho, abhanyamile, mutaija mukasobherwa nkubhaidi bhona, abhafanie mazima, abhilo ebhikuija."
222314510,1TH,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.","Kiturabha nitwesiga,  Yesu akafayasubha, yaimbuka nikwo chilichityo katonda naja kubhalata hano na Yesu bhaluija abhanyamile omukufa, kulabhila omulianene."
222314511,1TH,4,15,"For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left at the coming of the Lord, will surely not go before those who have fallen asleep.","Omulyebho, nitubhangambira imwe omuchigambo cha mukama, ngu itwe abhalikurora, abhalabhu bhachaliho achilo chukuija kwa mukama, tiluli kubha tango abhaliya abhanyamile, omekufa."
222314512,1TH,4,16,"For the Lord himself will descend from heaven. He will come with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.","Olukubha, mukama wenene najikusuma kuluga omubhichu. Naji kwija nomwotoguago wuwo, nomweto, gaweilaka iya malaika mukama, hamo, nebhigeregere bhya katonda nabho, habhafuila omulikristo, nibhajakuhimbhuka, bhalibhambele."
222314513,1TH,4,17,"Then we who are alive, who are left, will together with them be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. In this way we will always be with the Lord.","Kandi itwe abhalikurora abhasigaraho, nitujakutelane nabho ombhichw, hamo nabho, kutanganwa, mukama haiguru, omuliecho nitujikwikara na mukama ebhilobhona."
222314514,1TH,4,18,"Therefore, comfort one another with these words.","Chityo mubhirangane, imke, omulimwe, omubhigambolubhi."
222318593,1TH,5,1,"Now concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.","Mbwenu omukanya aka, mulumuka tialiho nsonga eye chigambo chonachona chiandikwe alubhaji rwowanyu."
222318594,1TH,5,2,For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord is coming like a thief in the night.,"Orwokubha imwe nimumauyage, echilo chomukama inchija kwijo, nkomusuma natela fatuma omuchilo (omwitumbi)."
222318595,1TH,5,3,"When they say, ""Peace and safety,"" then sudden destruction will come on them. It will be like birth pains in a pregnant woman. They will in no way escape.","Alinya abhalikugamba aliho ""obulola na nobulozi,"" niho alishetani duletwa otamawyole. nihkebhisa okubhikukwata omukazi owenda. Talakilile mumuanda gwonagwona."
222318596,1TH,5,4,"But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that the day would overtake you like a thief.",Chonka omwe balumuna timuli mumwilima norwo chilo chakwija nkomusuma.
222318597,1TH,5,5,For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not sons of the night or the darkness.,Orwensonga imwe mwena mwena muli abana abechimuli amo nabhana abhomwihangwe. Itwe tituli bhana bechila anga bomwilima.
222318598,1TH,5,6,"So then, let us not sleep as the rest do. Instead, let us keep watch and be sober.",Arwecho tutanyama nkabhandi okubhalikumiama. Sana tubukaise obwile amo nokwelinda (tulebege).
222318599,1TH,5,7,"For those who sleep do so at night, and those who get drunk do so at night.",Orwokuba alikumyama mbabnyamo omuchilo nabaku sinda mbasinda omuchilo.
222318600,1TH,5,8,"But since we belong to the day, we must stay sober and put on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation for our helmet.","Akubha itwe tuli abana abhabwamusana, tulebege. Tujwale engabho yokiliza amo nokwenda, nekofila iyechoma, chilabha ncholeka amazi agobulokozi obwa amazima omukanya akalaijao."
222318601,1TH,5,9,"For God did not appoint us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,","Arwokubha Mungu talatuchagwie mbele, arwensonga  omumuhanda gwomukama Yesu Kristo."
222318602,1TH,5,10,"who died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.","Wenene niwe yatufeleile, kutulabha ntuleamnga tunagile ntuja kwikala amo nawe."
222318603,1TH,5,11,"Therefore comfort one another and build each other up, just as you are already doing.","Arwetho, musemelerwangane musaidiane, amo nokwomblelana imwe kweimwe, nkahati okwomulikukola."
222318604,1TH,5,12,"We earnestly appeal to you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you and who rule over you in the Lord and who instruct you,","Mulumuna ntubhasabha mubhamanye bhalinya abhalikubhakolela omulimwe, na bhalinya abhali ahaiguru yauyu, omulikatonda amo nabhalinya abhalikubhagorola."
222318605,1TH,5,13,and to esteem them highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.,"Ntusaba mubhamanye nokubhaha echitinisa nokubhaha engonzi, arwensonga yemilimo yabo. mugile obhulola namazima omulimwe."
222318606,1TH,5,14,"We exhort you, brothers: Warn those who are lazy, encourage the discouraged, help the weak, and be patient toward all.","Ntubalagilila, Balumuna: Mubataise abhalikugenda nibasobya, mubhatekemu omwoyo abalemiluse, mulokole abatalikwebhasa, mubha abhokwegumisiliza ahali bona."
222318607,1TH,5,15,"See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone. Instead, pursue what is good for one another and for all.",Mulebege atazokamu omuntu wena wena alikuholela echibhi na ne echibhi.
222318608,1TH,5,16,Rejoice always.,"Ahamuntu wena wena, arokukola mutyo mukoleebhintu etulige ali bhulyomo omulimwe amonomubhantu bhona. Musemelelwe omubhilo byona."
222318609,1TH,5,17,Pray without ceasing.,Miusabhe muno mutalikulekela.
222318610,1TH,5,18,In everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.,"Osime omukama Mungu, ahali bulikimo arwesonga ezo ni engozi zomukama Mungu ahalitwe omuli Yesu Kristo."
222318611,1TH,5,19,Do not quench the Spirit.,Mitamulamu oyo.

222318615,1TH,5,23,"May the God of peace sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Mungu owobulola agobheseleze Ombutakatifu, omutima nomwoyo amonomubili bikazwe ahali alungi nakanya kokwija kwo omulokozi waitu  Yesu Kristo."
222318616,1TH,5,24,"Faithful is he who calls you, the one who will also do it.","Wenene eyabheta nowamazima, nawenene niwe alikubhasa kukola."
222318617,1TH,5,25,"Brothers, pray also for us.","Mulumuna, tusabilane olundi."
222318618,1TH,5,26,Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.,Obhakaise abhana bhaisemo bhona ahakubhanywegela akanywegelo kalakatifu.

172011548,MAT,11,28,"Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy burdened, and I will give you rest.","Mwije ahali nyawe mwena abhalemirwe n'abhasikiliirwe, ndabhalemuura."
172011549,MAT,11,29,"Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.","Mwetweke enkomo yange, mwegere ahali inye, ensonga nyawe ngira obhufura n'obhwetohya, mara emyoyo yanyu erahumura."
172011550,MAT,11,30,"For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.""","Nobhona nyawe enkomo yange neyorobha, kandi omugugu gwange nigwanguha.”"
172015617,MAT,12,1,At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.,"Omu bhiro ebhyo Yesu akashangwa naraba omu misiri y'engano aha chiro cha Sabato. Abegesibwabe barumwa enjara, aho babanza kugutura ebhikumba bhy'engano bhabilya."
172015618,MAT,12,2,"But when the Pharisees saw that, they said to Jesus, ""See, your disciples do what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath.""","Abhafarisayo kubon'echo, bhamugambira bhati, “Olebhe, abegesibwa bawe nibhakora ekilikutangwa kukora ahali Sabato”"
172015619,MAT,12,3,"But Jesus said to them, ""Have you never read what David did when he was hungry, and the men who were with him?","Wenene abagambira ati, “Imwe timukasomaga echo Daudi yakozire obhwo yarumirwe enjara, n'abo yabaire ainabo:"
172015620,MAT,12,4,"He went into the house of God and ate the bread of the presence, which was unlawful for him to eat and unlawful for those who were with him, but lawful only for the priests.","okwo yatahire Rwensinga ya Katonda a akalya Omukate gw'Obusinge bwa Katonda, ogwo wenene n'abo yabhaire ainabho ababaire batalikujuburwa kulya, sana abakuhani bonka?"
172015621,MAT,12,5,Have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath but are guiltless?,"Anga timukasomaga omu Mateka okwo ahali Sabato abakuhani kababha bhali Rwensinga bhahagaza Sabato, mara bhatafakaire?"
172015622,MAT,12,6,But I say to you that one greater than the temple is here.,"Kambagambirenu, aha haliho alikukira Rwensinga ejo."
172015623,MAT,12,7,"If you had known what this meant, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.","Kubha nimumanya ensonga y'echigambo echi, ‘Tinkwenda chitambo, n'inyenda obhuganyizi,’ timwakuramwire bhataina ntambara."
172015624,MAT,12,8,"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.""",Aha bhw'enshonga Omwana w'Omuntu niwe abha mukama wa Sabato.”
172015625,MAT,12,9,Then Jesus left from there and went into their synagogue.,"Yesu arugayo, ataha omu sinagogi yabho."
172015626,MAT,12,10,"Behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, saying, ""Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"" so that they might accuse him of sinning.","Omwo hakaba alimu omuntu akabire omukono. Bhamubaza bhati, “Nikijubhurwa kuchiza omuntu ahali Sabato?” Aho bagendeleire kwija kumutoijera."
172015627,MAT,12,11,"Jesus said to them, ""What man would there be among you, who, if he had just one sheep, and if this sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath, would not take hold of it and raise it out?","abhabhaza ati, “N'oha omuli imwe ayakubha aina entaama, k'entaama ejo yakugwa omu china ahali Sabato, atakujikwata akajihyamu?"
172015628,MAT,12,12,"How much more valuable, then, is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.""",Omuntu taina nsonga mpango kusaga ntaama? Chityo okukora kurungi ahali Sabato nikijubhurwa.”
172015629,MAT,12,13,"Then Jesus said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" He stretched it out, and it was restored to health, just like the other hand.","Amara agambira omuntu ogwo ati, “Gorora omukono gwawe.” Omusaija agorora omukonogwe ogwo, guchira, guguma nk'ogundi."
172015630,MAT,12,14,But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him. They were seeking how they might destroy him.,"chonka Abhafarisayo bhaturuka bhamugyera omu chama, bhategeka okwo bharamwita."
172015631,MAT,12,15,"Jesus, knowing this, withdrew from there. Many people followed him, and he healed them all.","Yesu kayabhimanyire arugayo. Abhantu bhangi bhamuhondera, mara abhakiza bhona,"
172015632,MAT,12,16,"He commanded them not to make him known to others,",chonka abharagira bhatamuranga.
172015633,MAT,12,17,"that it might be fulfilled, what had been said through Isaiah the prophet, saying,","Echo kikabhaho kugobesheleza echagambirwe Omurangi Isaya ati,"
172015634,MAT,12,18,"""See, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved one, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.","“Lebha omwiru wange owo ndonkire, omugonzibwa wange ansemelera. Ndamuteka Mwoyo wange aha mutwe, amanyise abhanyamahanga amazima."
172015635,MAT,12,19,He will not strive nor cry aloud; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.,"Talikungana anga kwomba, nangu n'omuntu kuhulira eirakalye omu mbarabhara y'echigo!"
172015636,MAT,12,20,"He will not break any bruised reed; he will not quench any smoking flax, until he leads justice to victory,","Talihenda rubhingo orwinamire, n'orutambi rulikwaka ekisiliira taliruraza, kuhika orwo alisinga aha bhw'okubha muhikiilire;"

172015638,MAT,12,22,"Then someone blind and mute, possessed by a demon, was brought to Jesus. He healed him, with the result that the mute man spoke and saw.","Kandi bamuletera empume mara omuteta ayabhaire aina sitani, amukiza, omutita agamba mara abhona."
172015639,MAT,12,23,"All the crowds were amazed and said, ""Can this man be the Son of David?""","Abantu bona batangara mara bagamba bati, “Ogu yakubha mwana wa Daudi?”"
172015640,MAT,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard of this miracle, they said, ""This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.""","chonka Abhafarisayo kabhabhihuliire bhagamba bati, “Omuntu ogu amasitani nagabhingisa amani ga Belizebuli, mukama wago.”"
172015641,MAT,12,25,"But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, ""Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.","Yesu obhwo yamanyire ebitekelezo bhyabo abhagambira ati, “Bhuli ngoma k'ebeganuka yonene yonka esiliika.

172015642,MAT,12,26,"If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?","Na Sitani k'abinga Sitani, wenene wenka abha abheganukire. Mbwenu aho engomaye yakuguma eta"
172015643,MAT,12,27,"And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason they will be your judges.","K'amasitani ndaba ningabingisa amani ga Belizebuli, aho imwe bhanyu abhegesibwa nibhagabingisa amani g'oha? Aha bhw'echo bhanyu nibho abjegesibwa bharabharamura."
172015644,MAT,12,28,"But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","chonka k'amasitani ndabha ningabingisa Mwoyo wa Katonda, aho lero obhukama bhwa Katonda bhwabhagobire."
172015645,MAT,12,29,How can anyone enter the house of the strong man and take away his belongings without tying up the strong man first? Then he will steal his belongings from his house.,Angasi omuntu yakutaha ata omw'Omuntu ow'amani akamunyaga ebhye atabhandize kuboha ow'amani ogwo akabha nibhwo ekabhuri enjuye?

172015647,MAT,12,31,"Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.","Aha bhw'echo mbagambire, abhantu bhalifakara n'okurogota bharogote mara bhagarulirwe, chonka alirogota ahali Mwoyo Mutakatifu ogwo taligarulirwa."
172015648,MAT,12,32,"Whoever speaks any word against the Son of Man, that will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, that will not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.","N'omuntu alirogota aha Mwana w'Omuntu aligarulirwa, chonka alirogota ahali Mwoyo Mutakatifu taligarulirwa, na mu nsi na mw'iguru"
172015649,MAT,12,33,"Make a tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.","“K'ogonza ebhirabha bhirungi, ohiige omuti ogurungi; anga ogonze ebhirabha bhibhi, ohiige omuti ogubhi. Omuti gumanyikira aha bhiraba bhyagwo."
172015650,MAT,12,34,"You offspring of vipers, since you are evil, how can you say good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.",Imwe ruzaro rw'enjoka! Mwakugamba muta ebirungi okwo muli babi? Manya ebijwire aha mutima nibyo akanwa kagamba.

172015653,MAT,12,37,"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.""",Ebhigambo ebhy'ogamba nibyo bilikuhindura mugorogoki mara balikuramulira aha bigambo byawe.”
172015654,MAT,12,38,"Then certain scribes and Pharisees answered Jesus and said, ""Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.""","Abhegesa bh'Amateka abhandi nh'Abafarisayo bagambira Yesu bhati, “Mwegesa, nitwenda okore akabhonero.”"
172015655,MAT,12,39,"But Jesus answered and said to them, ""An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign. But no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.","chonka abahorora ati, “Oruzaro rubhi oru nirwenda akabhonero; tigulikwija kuhabwa kabhonero, shana akabhonero ak'omurangi Yona."
172015656,MAT,12,40,"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the big fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.","Nk'okwo Yona yamazire ebhiro bisatu n'emisana yaho omu nfuru emumizire, nikwo n'Omwana w'Omuntu alimara ebhiro bhisatu n'emishana yaho omu kabhuri."
172015657,MAT,12,41,"The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation of people and will condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and see, someone greater than Jonah is here.","Abhantu bha Ninive bhaliimukira chimo na imwe bhabhatoijere aha chiro ch'eiramu, kubha bonene obhwo Yona yabarangiire bhakechuza, kandi haliho omuhango kusaga Yona."
172015658,MAT,12,42,"The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them. She came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see, someone greater than Solomon is here.","Omukamakazi wa Seba aha chiro ch'eiramu aliimuchira chimo na imwe abhatoijere, aha rw'ensonga akaruga hare muno kwehulilira obhumanyi bhwa Solomoni, mara aha haliho omuhango kusaga Solomoni."
172015659,MAT,12,43,"When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man, it passes through waterless places and looks for rest, but does not find it.","“Obhwo Sitani aruga omu muntu arabha mbali amaizi gatali nahiga obhwikaro, nawe tabhubhona."
172015660,MAT,12,44,"Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' Having returned, it finds the house empty—it had been swept clean and put in order.","Aho agamba ati, ‘Ndasubha omwange mbali naba ndugire.’ Mara obhwo aija asanga enjuye eli busai, eyeleleire mara bhuli kantu kali omu mwanya gwako."
172015661,MAT,12,45,"Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all come in to live there. Then the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first. It will be just like that with this evil generation.""","Nibhwo agenda akaleta amasitani agandi mushanju agabhi kumusaga, gatahamu gatur'omwo.

172015662,MAT,12,46,"While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.","Yesu kayabhaire aliho nafumolera abhantu, lebha nyina n'abarumuna bemelera aheru, nibhasabha kufumora nawe."
172015663,MAT,12,47,"Someone said to him, ""Look, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.""","Aho omuntu omo amugambira ati, “Lebha nyoko na bharumuna bhawe bhemeleire aheru, nibhenda kufumora naiwe.”"

172019713,MAT,13,1,On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.,chr'echo chonene Yesu aruga omu nju egyo ashuntama aha mwegego gw'enyanja.
172019714,MAT,13,2,"A very large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat in it while the whole crowd stood on the beach.","Abhantu bhangi bjamuhurulira, aja omu bhwato asuntamamu. Abhantu abho bhona bhaikara bhemeleire aha mwaro."
172019715,MAT,13,3,"Then Jesus said many things to them in parables. He said, ""Behold, a farmer went out to sow seed.","Abhagambira ebhintu bjingi omu nfumo ati, “Omubhyazi akasohors kubhyara."
172019716,MAT,13,4,"As he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and devoured them.","Kayabhaire nabhyara, empambo ezindi zagwa aha muhanda, ebhinyonyi bhija bhizilya."
172019717,MAT,13,5,"Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up because the soil had no depth.","Empambo ezindi zagwa aha nsi ey'orwazi ahataina itaka lingi, zanguha zimera aha rw'eitaka kutaba lingi."
172019718,MAT,13,6,"But when the sun had risen, they were scorched because they had no root, and they withered away.","chonka omusana kagwajwire zahotoka, mara aha rw'ensonga y'okutajira mizi zayoma."
172019719,MAT,13,7,Other seeds fell among the thorn plants. The thorn plants grew up and choked them.,"Empambo ezindi zikagwa omu mahwa, amahwa gakura gazibhuza obhwikizo."
172019720,MAT,13,8,"Other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.","Empambo ezindi zikagwa aha itaka lirungi zarabha. Ezindi zikarabha 100 omu 100, ezindi 60, ezindi 30."
172019721,MAT,13,9,"He who has ears, let him hear.""",Arabha aina amatu ahulire.
172019722,MAT,13,10,"The disciples came and said to Jesus, ""Why do you talk to the crowd in parables?""","Aho abhegesibhwa bhaija bhabhaza Yesu bhati, “Kubhachi nobhagambira omu nfumo?”"
172019723,MAT,13,11,"Jesus answered and said to them, ""You have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.","Abhahorora ati, “Imwe muhairwe kumanya enama z'obhukama bhw'omw'iguru, chonka bjonene echo tibhachihairwe."
172019724,MAT,13,12,"For whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.","Aha rw'ensonga arabha aina ebhyo ainabhyo niwe arahabhwa ebisagireho, mara ajire bhingi kusagaho. Chonka olinya ataina kantu, nangu n'ako ainako bhalikamwaka."
172019725,MAT,13,13,"This is why I talk to them in parables: Though they are seeing, they do not see; and though they are hearing, they do not hear, or understand.","Nicho ndikubhagambilira omu nfumu, okubhona tibhabhona, n'okuhulira tibhahulira, n'okusobhokerwa chei."
172019726,MAT,13,14,"To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says, 'Listening, you will hear, but you will never understand; seeing, you will see, but you will never know.","Echo Isaya yarangire nikigobheshelezibhwa ahali bhonene, akagamba ati, ‘Mulihulirakwo, chonka timulishobhokerwa n'akake, N'okubhona mulibonakwo, chonka timulibhyekomya."
172019727,MAT,13,15,"For the heart of this people has become dull, and with their ears they hardly hear, and they have shut their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and turn again, and I would heal them.'","Manyasi abhantu abha emitima yabho ekabjisara, n'amatu gabho geinamu ebhinyasi, n'amaiso gabho gabhunyize, bateija bhakabhonesa maiso gabho bhakekomya, bhakahuliza matu gabho, bhakasobhokerwa n'emitima yabho, bhakakubhuka bhakaija ahali nyawe nkabhachiza.’"
172019728,MAT,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.","“chonka gabherwa amaiso ganyu kubha nigabhona, n'amatu ganyu gabherwa obhwo galikuhulira."
172019729,MAT,13,17,Truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see and did not see them. They desired to hear the things that you hear and did not hear them.,"Nimbagambira amazima, abharangi bhangi n'abjantu abhagorogoki bharamiilizaga kubhona ebhyo mulikubhona, chonka tibabiboine; n'okuhulira ebyo mulikuhulira, chonka tibabihuliire."
172019730,MAT,13,18,Listen then to the parable of the farmer who sowed his seed.,“Mbwenu inywe muhulire enfumo y'omubhyazi.
172019731,MAT,13,19,"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the seed that was sown beside the road.","K'omuntu ahulira echigambo ch'obhukama bw'omw'iguru atakishobokeirwe, sitani aija aswaikura echabha kibibirwe omu mutimagwe; ejo niyo mpambo eyabhibhirwe ekagwa omu muhanda."
172019732,MAT,13,20,"What was sown on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,","Empambo eyabhyairwe aha nsi ey'orwazi, ogu niwe muntu ahulira echigambo akakitora bhwangu n'ebhyera,"
172019733,MAT,13,21,"yet he has no root in himself and he endures for a while. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he quickly falls away.","chonka wenene taina mizi, abhanza agumaho akhabanga kake, chonka k'akwatwa ebhiyengo anga bhakamugingiiza nibhamutura echigambo echo, aho n'aho agwa."
172019734,MAT,13,22,"What was sown among the thorn plants, this is the person who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.","Empambo eyabheirwe ekagwa omu mahwa, ogu niwe muntu ahulira echigambo, chonka akarahuro k'ensi n'okunulirwa eitunga bhituhikanisa echigambo echo, kibha kitakigira biraba."
172019735,MAT,13,23,"The seed that was sown on the good soil, this is the person who hears the word and understands it. He bears fruit and produces a crop, yielding in one case a hundred, in another sixty, and in another thirty times as much as was planted.""","Empambo eyabhyeirwe aha itaka lirungi, niwe muntu ahulira echigambo akakisobokerwa; mara kandi araba ebiraba, ondijo arabha 100, ondijo 60; ondijo 30.”"
172019736,MAT,13,24,"Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, ""The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.","Yesu asubha bachwera abegesibwabe enfumo endijo ati, “Obhukama bw'omw'iguru bhwakulengwa omuntu ayabhyaire empambo nungi omu ndimiroye."

172019738,MAT,13,26,"When the blades sprouted and then produced their crop, then the weeds appeared also.","Engano kayakuzire ekarabha, bhabha nibhwo bhabhona enkenzi ejo."
172019739,MAT,13,27,"The servants of the landowner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How does it now have weeds?'","Abhairu bha nyin'enju bhaija bamugambira bhati, ‘ omu ndimiro yawe tiwabhibhiremu mpambo enungi? Mbhwenu enkenzi erugire nkahi?’"
172019740,MAT,13,28,"""He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' ""The servants said to him, 'So do you want us to go and pull them out?'","Abhagambira ati, ‘Omubhi niwe abhibhiremu enkenzi ejo.’ Abairu bhamubaza bhati, ‘Noyenda tugende tujihyemu?’"
172019741,MAT,13,29,"""The landowner said, 'No. Because while you are pulling out the weeds, you might uproot the wheat with them.","Wenene abhahorora ati, ‘Mutaihyamu nkenzi mutaija mukaginyukulirana na ngano."
172019742,MAT,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest. At the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, ""First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.""'""","Bhyona bhibili bhikure hamo kulemwa kugoba aha isarura.

172019743,MAT,13,31,"Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, ""The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.","Yesu mara bachwera abegesibwabe enfumo endijo ati, “Objukama bw'omw'iguru nibushusha enjuma ya Haradali ey'omuntu yakwete akabiba omu ndimiroye."
172019744,MAT,13,32,"This seed is indeed the smallest of all seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants. It becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.""","Omu mpambo zona yonene niyo eba nke kuzishaga.

172019745,MAT,13,33,"Jesus then told them another parable.

172019746,MAT,13,34,All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and he said nothing to them without a parable.,Ebhigambo ebi byona Yesu yabigambiraga embaga omu nfumo. Taliho choyabagambiraga atakolize nfumo.

172077076,MAT,27,20,Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.,"Kandi abakuhani bakuru n'abagurusi bakaba niboohya abantu kushaba Baraba, kwita Yesu."

176173079,MRK,3,23,"Jesus called them to himself and said to them in parables, ""How can Satan cast out Satan?","Abeta abagambira omu migani ati, “Sitani yakubinga atai Sitani?"

176173086,MRK,3,30,"Jesus said this because they were saying, ""He has an unclean spirit.""","Okugamba atyo bakaba bagizire bati, “Ainamu eiSitani.”"
176173087,MRK,3,31,"Then his mother and his brothers came and stood outside. They sent for him, summoning him.","Nyina n'abarumuna baija, batuma ow'okumubetera, chonkai bemeleire aheru."
176173088,MRK,3,32,"A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him, ""Your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside, and they are looking for you.""","Embaga ekaba emutaire omugati; harugwaho ab'okumugambira bati, “Nyoko na barumuna bawe na banyanyoko bali aheru nibakubaza.”"

176177153,MRK,4,1,"Again he began to teach beside the sea, and a large crowd gathered around him. He stepped into a boat that was on the sea, and he sat down in it. The whole crowd was on the shore beside the sea.","Yesu ashuba abanza kwegesa aha Nyanja ya Galilaya. Abantu bangi muno basikuka bamugoba, ataha omu bwato omu nyanja abushuntamamu.

176177154,MRK,4,2,"He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching, this is what he said to them.","Abegesa ebintu bingi muno omu nfumo; abegesa nagamba ati,"

176177162,MRK,4,10,"When Jesus was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.","Yesu kayabaire yasigaire wenkai, ababaire bamuli haihi, hamoi n'eikumi na babili, bamubaza emigani egyo."
176177163,MRK,4,11,"He said to them, ""To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those outside everything is in parables,","Abagambira ati, “Inywe mushuruliirwe enama y'obukama bwa Ruhanga, kyonkai abali aheru abo nibagambirwa omu nfumo."

176177167,MRK,4,15,"These are the ones beside the road, where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.",Aba nibo bali omu muhanda mbali ekigambo kilikubibwa. Orwo balikukihulira Sitani ayanguha aija aihyamu ekigambo ekyo ekyababibwamu.

176177169,MRK,4,17,"But they do not have root in themselves, but they endure for a while. Afterward when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, they immediately fall away.","Kyonkai omu mitima yabo tibaina mizi. Nibaikara n'ekigambo akanya kagufi.

176177170,MRK,4,18,"Still others are the ones sown among the thorns. They are those who hear the word,","Abandi nizo mbibo ezibibirwe omu mahwa. Nibo bahulira ekigambo,"
176177171,MRK,4,19,"but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, and it is unproductive.","kyonkai akahyahyano k'ensi n'okunulirwa eitunga, n'orwoyoyo rw'ebintu ebindi bibatahamu bifundagatanisa ekigambo kiburwa obwikizo, kiba kitakiraba."

176177176,MRK,4,24,"He said to them, ""Pay attention to what you hear, for the measure you use will be measured to you, and more will be added to you.","Ashuba abagambira ati, “Ebyo mulikuhulira mubyekomye! Eiramu elyo muramura banu nilyo muliramurwa, nangu n'okushagaho."

176177178,MRK,4,26,"He also said, ""The kingdom of God is like a man who sows his seed on the ground.","Yesu ayeyongera abagambira ati, “Obukama bwa Ruhanga nibushusha okwo omuntu yakunaganagire embibo aha itaka,"

176177181,MRK,4,29,"When the crop is ripe, he immediately sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.""","Engano k'emara kwera, talinza, akwata orwabyo ashara, manyasi eigesha lyahika.”"
176177182,MRK,4,30,"Again he said, ""To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to explain it?","Yesu gamba ati, “Obukama bwa Ruhanga tubushushaniseki, anga nfumoki eyo turachwa ekabushoborora?"
176177183,MRK,4,31,"It is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth.","Nibushusha enjuma ya Haradali. Enjuma egyo kubibwa omu itaka, omu nsi zona omu njuma niyo eba nke bwoli bwoli."
176177184,MRK,4,32,"Yet, when it is sown, it grows and becomes greater than all the garden plants, and it forms large branches, so that the birds of heaven can make their nests in its shade.""","Orwo ebibwa ekura erugwamu ekiti kihango muno kushaaga ebiti ebindi byona, kigira amatagi gahango, n'ebinyonyi bigombekamu ebishunkuli.”"
176177185,MRK,4,33,"With many parables like this he spoke the word to them, as much as they were able to understand,",Yabagambiraga ekigambo omu nfumo nk'ezi ezo bashoboraga kushobokerwa.
176177186,MRK,4,34,"and he did not speak to them without a parable. But when he was alone, he explained everything to his own disciples.","Tiyabagambiraga atabachweleire nfumo, kyonkai kayabaga yasigaire n'abegesibwa ba wenene abaitoitorolera buli kantu."
176177187,MRK,4,35,"On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, ""Let us go over to the other side.""","Kir'ekyo kalyatobeire Yesu agambira abegesibwabe ati, “Tushabuke tugye buseli.”"
176177188,MRK,4,36,"So they left the crowd, taking Jesus with them, just as he was, in the boat. There were other boats going along with him.","Basigaho embaga, bagenda nawe omu bwato, kyonkai wenene akashangwa yabutahiremu. Kandi akaba ainaho amato agandi."
176177189,MRK,4,37,"Just then a violent windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was almost full of water.","Omuyaga gwija n'amani, amayengo gatera nigagwa omu bwato, obwato buralira kwijura."
176177190,MRK,4,38,"But Jesus himself was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke him up, saying, ""Teacher, do you not care that we are about to die?""","Yesu akaba ali aha ngoba y'obwato, ayeshagwire omuto anagiire. Bamusisiimura nibamugambira bati, “Mwegesa, watuleka twafa?”"
176177191,MRK,4,39,"He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, ""Peace! Be still!"" Then the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.","Asisiimuka akabukira omuyaga, agambira n'enyanja ati, “Hora! Chuleera!” Omuyaga gubutama, habaho obuchulezi bungi."
176177192,MRK,4,40,"Then he said to them, ""Why are you afraid? Do you still not have faith?""","Agambira abegesibwa ati, “Nimutinisibwaki? Timulikunyesiga?”"
176177193,MRK,4,41,"They were filled with great fear and said to one another, ""Who then is this, because even the wind and the sea obey him?""","Bakwatwa obutini bungi babazangana bati, “chonka  ogu ab'ohai, kuhulirwa omuyaga n'enyanja?”"
176181249,MRK,5,1,"They came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.","Yesu n'abegesibwabe bagoba buseli bunu bw'enyanja, omu nsi y'Abanyagerasi."
176181250,MRK,5,2,"When Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came up to him out of the tombs.","Kayamazire kuruga omu bwato, omushaija aruga omu nziiko akwetwe eiSitani aija amutahiremu."
176181251,MRK,5,3,"The man lived in the tombs. No one could restrain him anymore, not even with a chain.","Wenene ogwo yaturaga omu nyanga, bakaba batakimuboha, nangu n'omunyororo gwonkai kugumutaho."
176181252,MRK,5,4,He had been bound many times with shackles and with chains. He tore the chains apart and his shackles were shattered. No one had the strength to subdue him.,"Bamukomaga n'empingo n'eminyororo chonka eminyororo agigutura, n'empingo azihendahenda ebigutuka. Taliho muntu yakushoboire kumwelenga."
176181253,MRK,5,5,"Every night and day in the tombs and in the mountains, he cried out and cut himself with sharp stones.","chiro na mushana yaikaraga nakunga omu nyanga n'omu mabanga, nayekaratuza amabare."
176181254,MRK,5,6,"When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran to him and bowed down before him.","Kayamazire kubonera Yesu harai, agenda airukire amufukamira."
176181255,MRK,5,7,"He cried out with a loud voice, ""What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you by God himself, do not torment me.""","Akunga n'eiraka lihango, ati, “Nonyenzaki iwe Yesu Mwana wa Rukirabyona? Nakutaho Katonda otanshasa.”"
176181256,MRK,5,8,"For he had been saying to him, ""Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.""","Okugamba atyo Yesu akaba amugambiire ati, “Iwe Sitani omuntu ogu omurugemu!”"
176181257,MRK,5,9,"He asked him, ""What is your name?"" He answered him, ""My name is Legion, for we are many.""","Yesu abaza Sitani ati, “Eibara wab'ohai?” Ahorora ati, “Eibara lyange ndi Ihe; aha rw'okuba tuli bangi.”"
176181258,MRK,5,10,He begged him again and again not to send them out of the region.,Amutagiliza muno Amasitani ago atagabinga mu nsi egyo.
176181259,MRK,5,11,"Now a great herd of pigs was there feeding on the hill,",Aho hakaba haliho obuhyo bungi bw'empunu nizilya omw'ibanga;
176181260,MRK,5,12,"and they begged him, saying, ""Send us into the pigs; let us enter into them.""","gamutagiliza gati, “Otutaishure tugye omu mpunu.”"
176181261,MRK,5,13,"So he allowed them; the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep hill into the sea, and about two thousand pigs drowned in the sea.","Aba nikwo agajubura, omushaija gamurugamu, gataha omu mpunu, zikaba nizelenga kugoba omu 2,000. Zihilingita aha bulengo, zigwa omu nyanja zitontobera."
176181262,MRK,5,14,"Then those who were feeding the pigs ran away and reported what had happened in the city and in the countryside, and so people went out to see what had happened.","Abashumba bairuka, ebyo babona eba baruro omu kigo n'omu byaro. Abantu baija kwelebera ekyabaho."
176181263,MRK,5,15,"Then they came to Jesus and they saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had been possessed by Legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.","Bakwata muhanda baija ahali Yesu, babona ayabaire akwetwe Amasitani ali aho ashuntamire, ajwete mara aina amagezige gona, omuntu ayabaire aina eihe ly'Amasitani, batina."
176181264,MRK,5,16,"Those who had seen what happened to the demon-possessed man told them about it in detail, and they also told them about the pigs.",Ababaire baboine eky'omurwaire w'Amasitani n'ebyaba aha mpunu babarura.
176181265,MRK,5,17,Then they started to beg him to leave their region.,Abantu babanza kutagiliza Yesu k'abarugira omu nsi yabo.
176181266,MRK,5,18,"When he was getting into the boat, the demon-possessed man begged him that he might be with him.",Kayabaire nataha omu bwato omushaija ayabaire akwetwe Amasitani amushaba kugenda nawe.
176181267,MRK,5,19,"But Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, ""Go to your house and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you, and how he has shown you mercy.""","Yesu ayanga, amugambira ati, “Oshube owanyu obone bataahi bawe, obagambiire byona eby'Omukama yakukolera, n'okwo yakuganyira.”"
176181268,MRK,5,20,"So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis the great things that Jesus had done for him, and everyone was amazed.","Omushaija akwata omuhanda agaruka omu nsi y'ebigo 10 ebyayetwaga Dekapoli, agamba ebyo Yesu yamukolera; abantu bona batangara."
176181269,MRK,5,21,"Now when Jesus had crossed over again to the other side in the boat, a great crowd gathered around him, as he was beside the sea.","Orwo Yesu yagarukire buseli akashabuka n'obwato, embaga emuhurulira nyingi, aho wenene ali haihi n'enyanja."
176181270,MRK,5,22,"Then one of the leaders of the synagogue named Jairus came, and when he saw him, fell at his feet.","Aijwa omukuru omoi w'esinagogi eibaralye Yairo. Kayamazire kubona Yesu amugwa omu maguru,"
176181271,MRK,5,23,"He begged again and again, saying, ""My little daughter is near death. I beg you, come and lay your hands on her that she may be made well and live.""","amutagiliza ati, “Kahara kange kali haihi kufa. Singa oije okateho omukono kakire, karore.”"
176181272,MRK,5,24,"So he went with him, and a great crowd followed him and pressed close around him.","Yesu agenda na Yairo. Abantu bangi bamuhondera, nibamufunza oku n'oku omu muhanda."
176181273,MRK,5,25,Now a woman was there who had a flow of blood for twelve years.,"Hakaba haliyo omukazi arwaire ekiganga emyaka 12,"
176181274,MRK,5,26,"She had suffered much from many doctors and had spent everything that she had, but instead of getting better she grew worse.","yagiire aha batambi batali bake, empiha zamuhoire aha mukono, aburwa kwikya, anenwa kushagaho."
176181275,MRK,5,27,"When she had heard the reports about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak.","Akaba yahuliize Yesu, aho aruga enyuma amuhondeire akwata aha kijwarokye."
176181276,MRK,5,28,"For she said, ""If I touch just his clothes, I will be healed.""","Akaba nagira ati, “N'orwo ndakwata aha bijwarobye kushai ndakira.”"
176181277,MRK,5,29,"When she touched him, the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her affliction.","Aho n'aho ekiganga kilekera, ayehulira n'omu rugingo okwo yakira oburwaire."
176181278,MRK,5,30,"Jesus immediately realized in himself that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, ""Who touched my clothes?""","Yesu kuhulira okwo amani gamurugamu, akubuka bwangu amaisho aganaga omu mbaga, abaza ati, “Ayakwata aha bijwaro byange n'ohai?”"
176181279,MRK,5,31,"His disciples said to him, ""You see this crowd pressed around you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'""","Abegesibwabe bamugambira bati, “Nobona okwo embaga ekutangatangire embaju zona, noshuba nobaza oti, ‘Ayankwataho n'ohai?’ ”"
176181280,MRK,5,32,But Jesus looked around to see who had done it.,Wenene aleba oku n'oku nahiga ayamukwataho.
176181281,MRK,5,33,"The woman, knowing what had happened to her, feared and trembled. She came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.","Nawe omukazi akashangwa namanya ebyamubaho, aija natina, nachundwa, amugwa omu maisho amugambira amazima gona."
176181282,MRK,5,34,"He said to her, ""Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed from your affliction.""","Yesu amugambira ati, “Mwana wange, okwesiga kwawe kwakukiza; ogende n'emilembe mara okire oburwaire.”"
176181283,MRK,5,35,"While he was speaking, some people came from the synagogue leader's house, saying, ""Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any longer?""","Kayabaire akyagamba haliho abarugire omw'omukuru w'esinagogi, bagamba bati, “Muhara wawe yafire. Omwegesa otamwita kubi; lekera.”"
176181284,MRK,5,36,"But when Jesus overheard the message that was spoken, he said to the leader of the synagogue, ""Do not be afraid. Just believe.""","Ebyo bagamba Yesu tabitaho mutima, agambira omukuru w'esinagogi ati, “Otatina, iwe ekikuru oyesige.”"
176181285,MRK,5,37,"He did not permit anyone to accompany him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.","Atanga ab'okumuhondera, shana Petero na Yakobo n'omurumuna Yohana."
176181286,MRK,5,38,They came to the house of the leader of the synagogue and he saw there people making a lot of noise; they were weeping and wailing loudly.,"Orwo baagobire omw'omukuru w'esinagogi, ashanga abantu nibachura eyobobo."
176181287,MRK,5,39,"When he entered the house, he said to them, ""Why are you upset and why do you weep? The child is not dead but sleeps.""","Kayamazire kutaha omu nju ababaza ati, “Kiki nka muliyo nimuchura eyobobo? Omwana tafire anagiire.”"
176181288,MRK,5,40,"They began to mock him. But he put them all outside and took the father of the child and the mother and those who were with him, and he went in where the child was.","Bamushekelera. Abaturukya aheru. Akwata Yairo na mukaziwe n'abo yabaire ainabo, ataha omu kiyumba eky'omwana yabaire halimu."
176181289,MRK,5,41,"He took the hand of the child and said to her, ""Talitha, koum!"" which is translated, ""Little girl, I say to you, get up.""","Akwata omwana omukono, amugambira ati, “Talita kumi;” nikwo kugir'oti, “Kaisiki ninkugambira imuka.”"
176181290,MRK,5,42,Immediately the child got up and walked (for she was twelve years of age). They were immediately astonished with overwhelming amazement.,"Niho honkai omwisiki aimuka atambuka (akaba aina emyaka ikumi n'ebili), bagwa omu kitangaro."
176181291,MRK,5,43,He strictly ordered them that no one should know about this. Then he told them to give her something to eat.,"Abatanga muno ekigambo eki kukigambira abantu, ashuba abagambira kumuha ak'okulya."
176185345,MRK,6,1,"He went out from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.","Yesu aruga mbali yabaire ali, agaruka owabo. Abegesibwabe bamuhondera."
176185346,MRK,6,2,"When the Sabbath came, he taught in the synagogue. Many people heard him and they were amazed. They said, ""Where did he get these teachings?"" ""What is this wisdom that has been given to him?"" ""What are these miracles that he does with his hands?""","Ahali Sabato ayegesa omu sinagogi. Bangi abamuhuliire bashoberwa, bebaza bati, “Omuntu ogu ebi byona akabiyaha? Akahabwa bumanyiki obu? Eby'alikukora by'amani bitai?"
176185347,MRK,6,3,"""Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are his sisters not here with us?"" They were offended by Jesus. ","Ti museremara ogu? Aba mutabani wa Maria, ni murumuna Yakobo, na Yose, na Yuda, na Simoni, na banyanya tutura nabo munu.” Bamwanga."
176185348,MRK,6,4,"Then Jesus said to them, ""A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household.""","Yesu abagambira ati, “Omurangi takaburwaga kitinwa, shana owabo n'omu banyarugandabe n'omwabo mwonene.”"
176185349,MRK,6,5,"He could not do any mighty work, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.","Tiyakozireyo ch'amani, shana akatekaho abarwaire bake emikono mara yabakiza."
176185350,MRK,6,6,He was amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around the villages teaching.,Okutesiga kwabo kukamushobeza. Yesu agya omu byaro ebindi ayegesa.
176185351,MRK,6,7,"Then he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits,","Ayeta eikumi na babili, abatuma babili babili, abaha n'obushobora bw'okubinga Amasitani."
176185352,MRK,6,8,"and instructed them to take nothing for their journey, except a staff—no bread, no bag, and no money in their belts—",Abagambira kutatwara kantu kona kona omu rugendo shana enkoni. Omukate n'enshaho n'amahera omu mifuko ebyo chei.
176185353,MRK,6,9,"but to wear sandals, and not to wear two tunics.","Abajubura kujwara enkaito, chonka okujwara ekanzu ibili ayanga."
176185354,MRK,6,10,"He said to them, ""Whenever you enter a house, remain until you go away from there.","Abagambira ati, “Mbali muragyaga, enju eyo mulitahamu mwikare omwo kulemwa kugoba orwo mulirugayo."
176185355,MRK,6,11,"If any town will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave that place, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony to them.""","Hona hona mbali balibanga, bakanga n'okubahulira, kamulija kurugayo mukunkumure echuuchu aha maguru ganyu, balimanyir'aho.”"
176185356,MRK,6,12,They went out and proclaimed that people should repent.,chityo bagenda barangira abantu babone kwechuza amafu gabo.
176185357,MRK,6,13,"They cast out many demons, and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.","Babinga Amasitani gangi, basiiga abarwaire bangi amajuta babakiza."
176185358,MRK,6,14,"King Herod heard this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, ""John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.""","Omukama Herode abihulira, aha rw'okuba eibara lya Yesu likaba niliranganwa. Abantu abandi bakaba nibagamba bati, “Yohana Omubatiza ahimbukire omu bafu, niyo nshonga aina obushobora buti.”"
176185359,MRK,6,15,"Some others said, ""He is Elijah."" Still others said, ""He is a prophet, like one of the prophets in ancient times.""","chonka abandi bati, “Ni Eliya.” Abandi bati, “Murangi nk'abarangi aba karai.”"
176185360,MRK,6,16,"But when Herod heard this, he said, ""John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.""","Herode orwo yabihuliire ati, “Yohana owo natemireho omutwe ahimbukire.”"
176185361,MRK,6,17,"For Herod sent to have John arrested and he had him bound in prison on account of Herodias (his brother Philip's wife), because he had married her.","Herode akaba atumire ab'okukwata Yohana, bamuboha bamufunga nibamutura Herodia, muka Filipo murumuna Herode, aha rw'enshonga Herode akaba amushweire."
176185362,MRK,6,18,"For John told Herod, ""It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.""","Yohana akaba agambiire Herode ati, “Nikizira ahali iwe kushwera muramu wawe.”"
176185363,MRK,6,19,"But Herodias held on to anger against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not,","Nikwo Herodia kumukwatirwa enzigu, akagonza kumwita, kyonkai tiyashoboire,"
176185364,MRK,6,20,"for Herod feared John; he knew that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. Listening to him made him greatly perplexed, yet he heard him gladly.","kuba Herode yatinaga Yohana aha rw'okumumanya okwo ali mugorogoki mara mutakatifu, kityo yaba namulinda. Kayamazire kumuhulira yaikara nahwahwana muno omwoyo, kandi okwo yamuhuliilizaga n'amashemelerwa."
176185365,MRK,6,21,Then an opportunity came when Herod had his birthday and he made a dinner for his officials and for the commanders and leaders of Galilee.,"Bwija bushangwa buli bushango Herode nashemeza ekirokye ky'okuzarwa, akoleire abaramatabe n'abanyiginyabe n'abatwazi ba Galilaya obugenyi."
176185366,MRK,6,22,"The daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced for them, and she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, ""Ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you.""","Muhara wa Herodia aija amuzinira amushemeleza hamoi n'abagenyibe. Omukama agambira omwisiki ati, “Ongambire kyona kyona eky'olikwenda, ndakikuha.”"
176185367,MRK,6,23,"He swore to her saying, ""Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.""","Amwenahilira ati, “Eky'oranyenza kyona kyona ninkikuha, nangu n'enusu y'engoma yange.”"
176185368,MRK,6,24,"She went out and said to her mother, ""What should I ask him for?"" She said, ""The head of John the Baptist.""","Omwisiki aturuka abaza nyina ati, “Nshabeki?” Nyina ati, “Omutwe gwa Yohana Omubatiza.”"
176185369,MRK,6,25,"She immediately hurried back to the king, and she asked, saying, ""I want you to give me, right now, the head of John the Baptist on a wooden platter.""","Achwanisa agaruka owa Herode bwangu bwangu, amushaba ati, “Ningonza mbwenu aha ompe omutwe gwa Yohana Omubatiza aha sinia.”"
176185370,MRK,6,26,"Though this deeply grieved the king, he could not refuse her request because of the oath he had made and because of his dinner guests.","Omukama ajunara ebishobeize. Chonka  aha rw'ebyo yabaire anahiire n'enshoni z'abagenyibe, takunda kuchwa kigambo ekyo yabaire agambiire omwisiki ogwo."
176185371,MRK,6,27,So the king sent a soldier from his guard and commanded him to bring him John's head. The guard went and beheaded him in the prison.,"Arahuka atuma omwisherukare omulinzi, kuleta omutwe gwa Yohana. Omwisherukare agenda jela atema Yohana omutwe,"
176185372,MRK,6,28,"He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.",aguleta aha sinia aguheleza omwisiki. Omwisiki agutwalira nyina.
176185373,MRK,6,29,"When his disciples heard of this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.","Abegesibwa ba Yohana babihulira, baija batwara omubiligwe baguziika omu nyanga.v"
176185374,MRK,6,30,The apostles came together with Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught.,Entumwa zigaruka owa Yesu zimubaruulira ebyo zakozire byona n'ebyo zayegesize.
176185375,MRK,6,31,"Then he said to them, ""Come away by yourselves into a deserted place and rest a while."" For many were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.","Azigambira ati, “Mwije nywenkai mbali abantu batali, mwikyeho kake.” Nobona abaijaga aba nibagenda bakaba bali bangi, n'akanya k'okulya tibakukaboine."
176185376,MRK,6,32,So they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.,Bagenda bonkai omu bwato bagya mbali omwaga gutali.
176185377,MRK,6,33,"But they saw them leaving and many recognized them, and they ran there together on foot from all the towns, and they arrived there before them.","Abantu bangi bababona nibagenda mara babekomya, baruga omu bigo byona bairukire, batwarwa ogw'amaguru babagoberayo mbere."
176185378,MRK,6,34,"When they came ashore, he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.","Yesu aruga omu bwato agya aha mwaro abona embaga y'amani, abaganyibwa aha enshonga bakaba bali nk'entaama ezitaina mushumba. Abanza kubegesa bingi."
176185379,MRK,6,35,"When the hour was late, his disciples came to him and said, ""This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late.","Eizoba kalyalengire abegesibwabe bamugoba bamugambira bati, “Aha mbali tuli karungu, mara n'eizoba lyalenga."
176185380,MRK,6,36,"Send them away so that they may go into the nearby countryside and villages to buy something to eat for themselves.""",Obataishure bagye omu byaro ebili hagufi bagure akakulya.”
176185381,MRK,6,37,"But he answered and said to them, ""You give them something to eat."" They said to him, ""Can we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?""","Wenene abahorora ati, “Inywe mube n'inywe mubaha ak'okulya.” Bamubaza bati, “Ichwe tugende tugure omukate gw'edinari 200, tube nigwo tubaha kulya?”"
176185382,MRK,6,38,"He said to them, ""How many loaves do you have? Go and see."" When they found out, they said, ""Five loaves and two fish.""","Ababaza ati, “Mwina emikate engahai?” Bagya kuleba bamugambira bati, “Etanu n'enfuru ibili.”"
176185383,MRK,6,39,He commanded all the people to sit down in groups upon the green grass.,Aragira embaga yona kushuntama aha bunyasi omu bichweka.
176185384,MRK,6,40,They sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.,"Bashuntama omu bichweka, 100 omu 100, 50 omu 50."
176185385,MRK,6,41,"He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.","Yesu akwata emikate egyo etanu n'enfuru ibili, araramira eiguru, asiima, abegabegura emikate egyo, agiha abegesibwa kabagabira abantu. N'enfuru zombili azibagabira zona."
176185386,MRK,6,42,They all ate until they were satisfied.,Bona balya baiguta.
176185387,MRK,6,43,"They took up broken pieces of bread, twelve baskets full, and also pieces of the fish.",Bashombokya entukuru 12 z'obubeguka by'emikate n'enfuru.
176185388,MRK,6,44,There were five thousand men who ate the loaves.,"Abaliire omukate ogwo bakaba bali bantu 5,000."
176185389,MRK,6,45,"Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he sent the crowd away.","Yesu ayanguha agambira abegesibwabe kusabara omu bwato bakamwebembera buseli, Betisaida, oku nataishura embaga kutaha."
176185390,MRK,6,46,"After taking leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.",Kayabaire yarugangaineho nabo atemba omw'ibanga kushoma enshara.
176185391,MRK,6,47,"Evening came, and the boat was now in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on land.","Eizoba kutobera obwato bushangwa buli omu nyanja, kandi wenene ali wenkai aha mwaro."
176185392,MRK,6,48,"He saw that they were straining against the oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea, and he wanted to pass by them.","Abona okwo balikubuga nibyanga. Omuyaga gukaba nigwija gubataahiremu n'amani.

176185393,MRK,6,49,"But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought he was a ghost and cried out,","chonka kabamuboine natambuka aha maizi bamulenga kuba muzimu, bakunga;"
176185394,MRK,6,50,"because they saw him and were troubled. Immediately he spoke to them and said to them, ""Be courageous! It is I! Do not be afraid!""","nobona bona bakamubona batina. Ayanguha abagambira ati, “Mugume, n'inye; mutatina.”"
176185395,MRK,6,51,"He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased blowing. They were completely amazed.","Ataha omu bwato abashanga, n'omuyaga guchulera. Batangara muno munonga,"
176185396,MRK,6,52,"For they had not understood what the loaves meant. Instead, their hearts were hardened.",kuba ekyakozirwe aha mikate bakaba batakishobokeirwe aha rw'emitima yabo kugumangana.
176185397,MRK,6,53,"When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored the boat.","Orwo bamazire kushaabuka bagoba Genezareti, basiiga bagoromora obwato."
176185398,MRK,6,54,"When they came out of the boat, the people recognized him immediately,","Kabamazire kuruga omu bwato, abantu banguha bamanya Yesu."
176185399,MRK,6,55,and they ran throughout the whole region and began to bring the sick on their mats to wherever they heard he was.,"Bagenda nibairuka omu byaro ebili haihi, babanza kuleta abarwaire aha machera, nibabamushangisa hona hona mbali bamuhulizaga."
176185400,MRK,6,56,"Wherever he entered into villages, or cities, or into the country, they would put the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch the edge of his garment, and as many as touched him were healed.","Orwo yakaijaga omu byaro n'omu bigo, baleta abarwaire nibababyamika omu katare, bamutagiliza buzima kukwata aha mukugiro gw'ekijwarokye kushai.

176189441,MRK,7,1,The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him.,"Abafarisayo n'abegesa b'Amateka ababaire barugire Yerusalemu bagoba Yesu,"
176189442,MRK,7,2,"They saw that some of his disciples ate bread with hands that were unclean, that is, unwashed.","bagya babona okwo abegesibwabe abandi balikuliisa emikono ehagaire, nikwo kugir'oti etanabire."
176189443,MRK,7,3,"(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands carefully, because they hold to the tradition of the elders.","(Abafarisayo n'Abayahudi abandi bona, tibalya batanabire mikono, nibegendeleza emichwo ya baish'enkurubo."
176189444,MRK,7,4,"When the Pharisees come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they bathe themselves, and they hold to many other things they have received, such as the washing of cups, pots, copper vessels, and the couches upon which they eat.)","Kumara kuruga omu katare tibaina kulya batanabire.

176189445,MRK,7,5,"The Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, ""Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unclean hands?""","Abafarisayo n'abegesa b'Amateka bamubaza kubaki abegesibwabe batalikugendeleza michwo ya baishenkurubo, bakalisa emikono ehagaire."
176189446,MRK,7,6,"But he said to them, ""Isaiah prophesied well about you hypocrites.

176189449,MRK,7,9,"He also said to them, ""How well you reject the commandment of God so you may keep your tradition!","Abagambira ati, “Mwina akalyo k'okwanga emihango ya Katonda, mubone kuguma aha michwo yanyu!"
176189450,MRK,7,10,"For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of his father or mother will surely be put to death.'","Musa akagamba ati, ‘Okunire sho na nyoko;’ kandi ‘Ow'okukeena ishe anga nyina nakafe.’"

176189454,MRK,7,14,"He called the crowd again and said to them, ""Listen to me, all of you, and understand.","Yesu ashuba ayeta abantu abagambira ati, “Mumpulilize inywena mara mushobokerwe:"
176189455,MRK,7,15,"There is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into him. It is what comes out of the person that defiles him.""","taliho kintu kiruga njai kikataha mu muntu kikamuhagaza, shana ebimuruga omunda nibyo bimuhagaza."
176189456,MRK,7,16,,(Araba aina amatwi g'okuhulira ahulire).
176189457,MRK,7,17,"Now when Jesus left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.","Kayabaire yatahire omunju yasigireho abantu, abegesibwabe bamubaza enfumo egi."
176189458,MRK,7,18,"Jesus said, ""Are you also still without understanding? Do you not know that whatever enters into a person from outside cannot defile him,","Abagambira ati, “Lero nainywe timulikushobokerwa? Timulikubona okwo ekiruga aheru y'omuntu kikamutahamu tikyakumuhagaza?"
176189459,MRK,7,19,"because it cannot go into his heart, but it goes into his stomach and then passes out into the latrine?"" With this statement Jesus declared all foods clean.","Enshonga nikimutaha omu rubunda, tikilimutaha mu mwoyo, mara nikishuba nikituruka.” (Kityo akaba nagamba okwo ebyakulya byona tibiba bihagare.)"
176189460,MRK,7,20,"He said, ""It is that which comes out of the person that defiles him.","Agamba ati, “Ekiruga omu muntu nikyo kimuhagaza."
176189461,MRK,7,21,"For from within a person, out of the heart, proceed evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder,","Omu mutima gw'omuntu nimwo haruga ebitekelezo bibi: obusiyani, obushuma, okwita omuntu, obujanga,"

176189464,MRK,7,24,"He got up from there and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. There he went into a house, and he wanted no one to know where he was, yet he could not be hidden.","Yesu arug'okwo agya omu nsi eyataine Tiro na Sidoni.

176189465,MRK,7,25,But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down at his feet.,"Niho honkai omukazi yamuhuliize. Akashangwa aina omwana muto w'omwisiki akwetwe Sitani, aija agwa Yesu omu maguru."
176189466,MRK,7,26,"Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by descent. She begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter.","Omukazi akaba ali Mugirikikazi, ow'oruganda rw'Abasirofoiniki. Amutagiliza kubinga eiSitani omu muhara."

176189471,MRK,7,31,"Then he went out again from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee up into the region of the Decapolis.","Yesu aruga omu nsi eyataine Tiro, araba Sidoni agoba aha Nyanja ya Galilaya, alesirwe omu nsi y'ebigo 10 ebyayetwaga Dekapoli."

I beg you, do not torment me.""","Kiyambweine Yesu akatera endurun, akagwa omumeiso ge, aganbha omwiraka lihango, Nyine echiki naiwe? Yesu omwana wa Katonda ala ahiguru? ninkusabha otambhonabhonesa"
180387869,LUK,8,29,"For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and he would be driven by the demon into the wilderness.",Arwokubha Yahabhura eipepo libhi limurugenu omuntu olinya alokubha alarukile nawe ebhiro bhingi akalinda okumukoma kandi kukomwa eminyororo ne mpingo: akabhitema bhilinya ebhigubha akaeiruchwa omwijangwa omu mani ga lilinya ipepo.
180387870,LUK,8,30,"Then Jesus asked him, ""What is your name?"" He said, ""Legion,"" for many demons had entered into him.","Yesu akamubhaza, ibhara ryawe  elyohi? akagambha. Ibhara ndi Jeshi; Arokubha ebhiraru bhingi bhyamutahamu."
180387871,LUK,8,31,They kept begging him not to command them to go away into the abyss.,Bhakamusabha atabhahabhura bharugemu kugenda omuchina.
180387872,LUK,8,32,"Now a large herd of pigs was there feeding on the hillside. The demons begged him to let them go into them, and he gave them permission.",Aho akabha aliho kandi empunu zingi zilisa omwibhanga; bhakamusabha abhahe ejubhuro kubhatahamu bhalinya akabha ejubhuro
180387873,LUK,8,33,"So the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned.","Ebhiraru bhimurugamu omuntu olinya bhataha omumpunu, na lilinya ekundi likasoka Likataha omunyanja bhakafa amaizi ."
180387874,LUK,8,34,"When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and told about it in the city and countryside.",Abhakozi bhakatonda kibhabhwoine echa bhateho bhakairuka bhatangaza ehabhari omumuji nano omumashambha
180387875,LUK,8,35,"So the people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out. He was sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.","Abhantu bhakarugamu kugenda kulebha echatokea, bhakamugendelaq Yesu bhakamubhona omuntu olinya ayarugilwemu ne ebhiraru asitamile omaguru ga Yesu, ajwaile emyendo, aine amagezi gawenene; bhakatina."
180387876,LUK,8,36,Then those who had seen it told them how the man who had been possessed by demons had been healed.,Nabhalinya abhabhaire bharebhile bhakabhagambhira okwiyakilizwe olinya eyabhaire arwaile ebhiraru
180387877,LUK,8,37,"Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, for they were overwhelmed with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.","Ne charo echabhantu ebhensi eya Abhensi eya Abhagerasi eli haihi haihi bhakamusabha atahe owabho, arwokubha bhakakwata no kwebhaza kwingi aho akatembha abhwato, kagarukayo"
180387878,LUK,8,38,"The man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to let him go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,","Kandi omuntu olinya ayarugirwemu ebhiraru akamusabha ejubhuro agende nawe; chonka wenene akamuraga nagambha,"
180387879,LUK,8,39,"""Return to your home and give a full account of what God has done for you."" The man went on his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.","Subha omuka owawe, orangilile okwobhili bhikuru katonda ebhiyakukoleile. Akagenda narangilila ommuji gwona okwibhili bhikuru ebhintu ebhyakorerwa na Yesu."
180387880,LUK,8,40,"Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.",Yesu kiyagarukile itanganiro akamunyegeza omukusemererwa arokubha bhakabha bhamulinzire bhona.
180387881,LUK,8,41,"Behold, a man named Jairus, who was one of the leaders of the synagogue, came and fell down at Jesus' feet, and he begged him to come to his house","Kandi olebhe omuntu omo akaija, ibhala lya wenene yario, nawe no mntu mkuruowa sinagogi, akagwa omaguru ga Yesu, akamusabha atahemu omuka owawenene;"
180387882,LUK,8,42,"because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve years of age, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds of people pressed together around him.",Arwokubha omwisiki wawenene nayenda kufaeyabhaire alo omwana wenka emyaka ya wenene ekabha elikumi na ibhili kandi kiyabhaire nagenda.
180387883,LUK,8,43,Now a woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone.,Kandi omukazi omo ayarugirwemuobhwambha akabha akanya akemiaka ikumi na ibhili.

180387884,LUK,8,44,"She came behind Jesus and touched the edge of his coat, and immediately her bleeding stopped.","Akagenda enyuma yawenene, kubhandizao okurugamu obhwambha aliwenene, kukawa."
180387885,LUK,8,45,"Jesus said, ""Who was it who touched me?"" When all denied it, Peter said, ""Master, the crowds of people are all around you and they are pressing in against you.""","Yesu aganbha noi yakwatao? Hao abhantu bhona kibhayetongile, Petro akagambha katonda omukuru omukutano ogu, bhakuzungukile kandi bhakwilire."
180387886,LUK,8,46,"But Jesus said, ""Someone did touch me, for I know that power has gone out from me.""","Yesu aganbha aliyo omuntu ayakwatao, abhwokubha nindeba hamani gandugamu."""
180387887,LUK,8,47,"When the woman saw that she could not escape notice, she came trembling and fell down before him. In the presence of all the people she declared why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed.","Horinya omukazi, kiyabhwoine chityo tabhasa kweshereka heija  najugumaAkagwa omaisho gawenene yamukwatao, kandi nokwo yeichishwa."
180387888,LUK,8,48,"Then he said to her, ""Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.""","Hakamughambiraomwisiki, okwesiga kwakwechisa;genda kwawe no bhusinje."""
180387889,LUK,8,49,"While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader's house, saying, ""Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher any longer.""","Kiyabhaire nagambha hebhyo, hakeija omuntu kuruga omunju eyorinya omukuru we ogwo  ekanisa, hamughambhira, mwesiki wawe yafile; otamutenja mwalimu."""
180387890,LUK,8,50,"But when Jesus heard this, he answered Jairus, ""Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be healed.""","Chonka Yesu kiyauri ebhyo, akamuhorola, wenene neija kwicha."""
180387891,LUK,8,51,"When he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father of the child and her mother.","Kiyagobhire omunju tayanzire omuntu kujamu hamo nawenenechonka Petro wenka, haomo Yohana, hamo Yakobho, kandi neise womwana olinya hamo:"
180387892,LUK,8,52,"Now all were mourning and wailing for her, but he said, ""Do not weep; she is not dead but asleep.""","Kandi abhantu bhona abhabhaire mbharira kandi 
Mbhasasa; akagambha  mutalira tiyafa hogu, nangu anyamire kwonka."
180387893,LUK,8,53,"But they began to mock him, knowing that she was dead.","Bhakamusereka mno, abhwokubha bhakabha bhamanyire kubha ya file."
180387894,LUK,8,54,"But he took her by the hand and called out, saying, ""Child, get up!""","Akamukwata omukono, agambha muno nagambha musigazi imuka"
180387895,LUK,8,55,"Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He ordered them to get her something to eat.",Homutima gwawenene gumugarukila akanga hako hakemelela  Hakajubhuraa bhamue ebhakulya.
180387896,LUK,8,56,"Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.","Bhazaire bhawenene bhakagira etangaro muno, chonka hakabhatanga bhatagambhira omuntu ebhyazoka."
180391937,LUK,9,1,He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases.,"Yesu ayeta eikumi na babili, abaha amani n'obushobora bw'okubinga amasitani gona n'okuchiza endwara."
180391938,LUK,9,2,He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.,Amara abhatuma kuranga obukama bwa Katonda n'okuchiza abharwaire.
180391939,LUK,9,3,"He said to them, ""Take nothing for your journey—no staff, no wallet, no bread, no money, and no extra tunic.","Abagambira ati, “Mutagenda na kantu: Enkoni chei, omufuko chei, omukate chei, empiha chei, n'ekanzu mutatwara ibili."
180391940,LUK,9,4,"Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave.","Kaishe nju eyo muratahamu mwikare omwo, mute nimwema omwo."
180391941,LUK,9,5,"Wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.""","Mbali barabanga, orwo muraija kuruga omu kigo ekyo mukunkumure echuuchu aha maguru ganyu bamanyireho okwo batabakunda.”"
180391942,LUK,9,6,"Then they departed and went through the villages, proclaiming the gospel and healing everywhere.","Baimukya baraba omu byaro, buli hantu nibaranga evangeli nibakiza n'endwara."
180391943,LUK,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,","Omutwazi Herode kayahuliize byona ebyabaire nibikorwa, ashoberwa. Nobona abandi bakaba nibagamba okwo Yohana omubatiza ahimbukire,"
180391944,LUK,9,8,"and others said that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had risen.","abandi bati Eliya n'iwe aizire, abandi bati omu barangi ab'eirai alimu ahimbukire."
180391945,LUK,9,9,"Herod said, ""I beheaded John. Who is this about whom I hear such things?"" And so he tried to see him.","Herode wenene ati, “Yohana nkamutema ebikya; mbwenusi ogu n'ohai owo ndikuhulizaho ebi?” Aho ayenda kubona Yesu."
180391946,LUK,9,10,"When the apostles returned, they told him everything they had done. Then he took them with him, and they went away privately to a town called Bethsaida.","Entumwa kazabaire zagarukire, zabarulira Yesu byona ebyo zakora. Yakwata entumwa ezo yagenda nazo omu kigo kya Betisaida kweshelekayo abantu."
180391947,LUK,9,11,"But when the crowds heard about this, they followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.","Embaga kayakimanyire emuhonderayo. Abanyegeza, abafumoleraho obukama bwa Katonda, n'ababaire nibetaga kukizibwa abakiza."
180391948,LUK,9,12,"Now the day was about to come to an end, and the twelve came to him and said, ""Send the crowd away that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and food, because we are here in an isolated place.""","Aho eizoba libanza kutobera, nikwo eikumi na babili kumugambira bati, “Waitu, otaishure abantu bagende omu byaro ebili haihi bahige ak'okulya n'oburaaro; enshonga aha mbali tuli karungu.”"
180391949,LUK,9,13,"But he said to them, ""You give them something to eat."" They said, ""We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people.""","Ndi Yesu abagambira ati, “Inywe mube n'inywe mubaha ak'okulya.” Bagamba bati, “Titwina kantu, shana emikate etanu n'enfuru ibili, shana katuraba tuli b'okugenda kugulira abantu aba bona echakulya.”"
180391950,LUK,9,14,"(There were about five thousand men.) He said to his disciples, ""Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.""","Abantu bakaba bali nka 5,000. Yesu agambira abegesibwabe ati, “Mubagambiire bashuntame omu bichweka by'abantu 50 omu 50.”"
180391951,LUK,9,15,"So they did this, and made the people sit down.","Bagira batyo, bagambira bona bashuntama."
180391952,LUK,9,16,"Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, he blessed them and broke them into pieces, and he gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.","Kayakwete emikate etanu n'enfuru ibili araramira omw'iguru, abiha omugisha, abibegabegura aheleza abegesibwa kubigabira embaga."
180391953,LUK,9,17,"They all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up—twelve baskets of broken pieces.","Bona balya mara baiguta. Ebyasigaireho babishombokya, baijuza entukuru 12 z'obubeguka."
180391954,LUK,9,18,"It came about while Jesus was praying by himself, the disciples were with him. He questioned them, saying, ""Who do the crowds say that I am?""","Yesu kayabaire aina abegesibwa bali bonkai, nashoma enshara, ababaza ati, “Abantu nibagira bati ndi oha?”"

180391956,LUK,9,20,"Then he said to them, ""But who do you say that I am?"" Peter answered, ""The Christ of God.""","Kyonkai wenene ati, “Isi inywe nimugira muti ndi ohai?” Petero ahorora ati, “Iwe n'iwe Kirisito wa Katonda”"
180391957,LUK,9,21,"But he warned and instructed them to tell this to no one,","Aho Yesu akomeleza abegesibwabe kutabigambira muntu n'omo,"
180391958,LUK,9,22,"saying, ""The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and he will be killed and on the third day be raised.""","ati, “Omwana w'Omuntu naija kushasha nibamutura bingi, kandi abagurusi n'abakuhani bakuru n'abeegesa b'Amateka nibaija kumwanga bamwite, chonka aha kiro kya kashatu ahimbuke.”"
180391959,LUK,9,23,"Then he said to them all, ""If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.","Kandi agambira bona ati, “K'omuntu alikugonza kumpondera, ayeyange wenene, ayetweke omusarabagwe buli kiro, ampondere."

180391961,LUK,9,25,What profit is there for a person to gain the whole world and yet lose or forfeit himself?,Kuba Omuntu nagasirwaki kulya ensi yona chonka kandi akaferwa oburorabwe?

180391964,LUK,9,28,"Now about eight days after Jesus said these words, he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.","Ebiro kabyakeire nka munaana Yesu agambire ebigambo ebyo, atwara Petero na Yohana na Yakobo, atemba omw'ibanga kushoma enshara."
180391965,LUK,9,29,"As he was praying, the form of his face was changed, and his clothes became brilliant white.","Kayabaire nashoma enshara ahinduka aha maisho, ebijwarobye byengelera kundi."
180391966,LUK,9,30,"Behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah,",Leba abantu babili nibafumora nawe: Musa na Eliya.
180391967,LUK,9,31,"who appeared in glory, talking with him about his departure, which he was about to bring to completion in Jerusalem.","Bakazoka baina ekitinwa, bafumora aha kufakwe okulikwija kubaho omuli Yerusalemu."
180391968,LUK,9,32,"Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.","Aho Petero n'abo yabaire ainabo bakaba nibasomba.

180391969,LUK,9,33,"As they were going away from Jesus, Peter said to him, ""Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."" (He did not know what he was saying.)","K'ababili abo babaire nibamurugaho, Petero agambira Yesu ati, “Rugaba, kirungi kitai kubona tuli aha!

180391972,LUK,9,36,"When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.","K'eiraka lyamazire kugamba, bashanga Yesu yasigaire wenka. Besiza, omu bir'ebyo tibafumoleire muntu n'omoi ebyabaireho aha ibanga."
180391973,LUK,9,37,"Now on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.","Bukeire baraire barugire aha ibanga, Yesu abuganganwa abantu batali bake."
180391974,LUK,9,38,"Behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, ""Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.","Niho honkai omushaija ayema omu mbaga ataaga ati, “Mwegesa, ninkutagiliza osinge ogilire mutabani wange ekisha, ahakuba n'iwe mwana wange omumoi."
180391975,LUK,9,39,"You see, a spirit takes control over him and he suddenly screams; it causes him to have convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It hardly ever leaves him and it bruises him badly.","Eisitani liikara nilimukwata, aho akunga. Limukabisa nk'owensimbu alemwa agira n'ekifuzi aha munwa. Limushaasa muno tiliziza na kumutaishura."

180391978,LUK,9,42,"While the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and shook him with convulsions.

180449335,LUK,23,55,The women who had come with Jesus out of Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.,"Abakazi ababaire barugire Galilaya na Yesu nabo bahonderaho, babona enyanga, n'okwo omubili gwahumuzibwa omu nyanga egyo."
180449336,LUK,23,56,They returned and prepared spices and ointments. Then on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.,"Nibhwo bagarukire omuka, bakatekateka omugaju n'amajuta g'okwija kusiga omubili gwa Yesu. Aha chiro cha Sabato bahumura, nk'okwo omuhango gwabaire niguragira."

180453387,LUK,24,11,"But this message seemed like idle talk to the apostles, and they did not believe the women.","chonka ebaruro ejo ebabera rugano, tibagikiliize."
180453388,LUK,24,12,"Yet Peter rose up and ran to the tomb, and, stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves. Peter then departed to his home, wondering what had happened.","Petero ogwo aimuka airuka agire aha nyanga. Yainama yalinguliza, yabona okwo emyendo ya kitaani eli yonka.

180453400,LUK,24,24,"Some men who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said. But they did not see him.""","Abandi abo twaba twinabo bakwata omuhanda bagya aha nyanga, babishanga nk'okwo abakazi babigamba. Kyonkai Yesu wenene tibamubona.”"

180453403,LUK,24,27,"Then beginning from Moses and through all the prophets, Jesus interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures.","Atandikira ahali Musa n'abarangi bona, yagya n'omu Bihandiko Bitakatifu byona yabashoboorora byona ebyahandikirwe ahali Kirisito ogwo."

180453406,LUK,24,30,"It happened that, when he had sat down with them to eat, he took the bread, blessed it, and breaking it, he gave it to them.","Kayabaire naraagira nabo, akwata omukate, asiima, agubegura, agubaha."
180453407,LUK,24,31,"Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.","Aho amaisho gabo gabona, bamumanya; wenene ababura aha maisho."
180453408,LUK,24,32,"They said one to another, ""Was not our heart burning within us, while he spoke to us on the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?""","Bagambirangana bati, “Emitima yaitu tiyaba nebengeya orwo yaba natufumolera omu kihanda, natukyanura omu Bihandiko Bitakatifu?”"

180453413,LUK,24,37,But they were terrified and filled with fear and thought that they were seeing a spirit.,"Bahukuka, batiina, balenga bati babona omuzimu."
180453414,LUK,24,38,"Jesus said to them, ""Why are you troubled? Why do questions arise in your heart?","Ababaza ati, “Kiki, nka mwayechura, n'emitima yanyu neyebaza bingi?"
180453415,LUK,24,39,"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see me having.""",Mundebe ebiganja n'ebilenge. Omuzimu tigugira mubili na magufa nk'okwo ndi.”
180453416,LUK,24,40,"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.","Kayamazire kugamba atyo, yaboleka ebiganja n'ebilenge."
180453417,LUK,24,41,"They still could not believe it because of joy, and they were amazed. Jesus said to them, ""Do you have anything to eat?""","Kababaire batakaikiliize aha rw'ebyera, batangaire, ababaza ati, “Hanu aha mwinaho ak'okulya?”"
180453418,LUK,24,42,"They gave him a piece of a broiled fish,",Bamuheleza ekichweka ky'enfuru ekazirwe.

184565782,JHN,4,22,"You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.","Imwe bhantu nimuramya echimutarikumanya, chonka itwe nituramya echitukumanya, kubha obhurokozi mbhuruga omubhayuda.''"
184565783,JHN,4,23,"However, the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to be his worshipers.","Nangu, akanya nkajakugobha, na ati oryaha, akanya abhokuramya omumazima mbhajakuramya Tata omumwoyo no omumazima, obhwokubha Tata naiga abhantu abhengeri eji kubha abhantu bhawenene abhokumuramya."
184565784,JHN,4,24,"God is Spirit, and the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.""","Katonda ni mwoyo, na bharinya abhokumuramya bhasanirwe kumuramya omumwoyo na amazima.''"
184565785,JHN,4,25,"The woman said to him, ""I know that the Messiah is coming (the one called Christ). When he comes, he will explain everything to us.""","Omukazi  amugambhira, ''Nimanya okwo Masiya neija, (akwetwa Kristo). Ogu kareija najakutugambhira bhyona.''"
184565786,JHN,4,26,"Jesus said to her, ""I am he, the one speaking to you.""","Yesu amugambhira, ''Nyawe ndinye.''"
184565787,JHN,4,27,"At that moment his disciples returned. Now they were wondering why he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, ""What are you looking for?"" or ""Why are you speaking with her?""","Omukanya ako abhegesibhwa bhawenene bhagaruka. nabho bharagara kubhaki nafumora no omukazi, Chonka tariho yarengeise kumubhaza,

184565788,JHN,4,28,"So the woman left her water pot, went back to the town, and said to the people,","Chityo omukazi asigaho echikeni cha wenene agenda omuchigo abhagambhira abhantu,"

184565790,JHN,4,30,They left the town and came to him.,Bharuga omuchigo bheija owawenene.
184565791,JHN,4,31,"In the meantime, the disciples were urging him, saying, ""Rabbi, eat.""","Omukanya ko omusana abhegesibhwa bhakamutagiriza mbhagambha, ''Rabhi orye echakurya.''"
184565792,JHN,4,32,"But he said to them, ""I have food to eat that you do not know about.""","Chonka wenene, ''Nyawe nyine echakurya echimutakumanya imwe.''"
184565793,JHN,4,33,"So the disciples said to each other, ""No one has brought him anything to eat, have they?""","Abhegesibhwa bhagambhirana, tariho yamuretera echintu chona chona kurya, ''Isi bhakareta?'''"
184565794,JHN,4,34,"Jesus said to them, ""My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work.","Yesu abhagambhira, ''Chakurya change nokukora engonzi za wenene eyantwekire kumara omurimo gwawenene."
184565795,JHN,4,35,"Do you not say, 'There are four more months and then the harvest comes'? I am saying to you, look up and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest!","Isi, timukugambha, 'Achabhuraho emyezi etano okusarura nkujakubha kwabheileo?'

184565796,JHN,4,36,"He who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life, so that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.","Wenene akusharura nakwata echitago narundana ebhirabha obhwo obhurora bhutawaho, akabhyara na akusarura bhasemererwe amo."
184565797,JHN,4,37,"For in this the saying, 'One sows, and another reaps,' is true.","Kubha engabha eji na amazima, 'Omo nabhyara nondijo nasarura.'"
184565798,JHN,4,38,"I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.""","Nkamutweka kusarura echimutarasasire, Abhandi bhakozire omurimo neimwe mutahire omumasemererwa go emirimo yabho.''"
184565799,JHN,4,39,"Many of the Samaritans in that city believed in him because of the report of the woman who was testifying, ""He told me everything that I have done.""","Abhasamaria bheingi bhakamwesiga omuchigo chirinya obhwe ebhigambho bhyorinya omukazi eyabheire najurira, '' Eyangambhire ebhintu bhyona ebhinakozire.''"
184565800,JHN,4,40,"So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.",Nangu Abhasamariha kibheizire bhakamutagiriza eikare amo na bhonene eikala na bhonene ebhilo bhibhil.
184565801,JHN,4,41,Many more believed because of his word.,Na abhengi bhamwesiga  abhechigambho cha wenene.
184565802,JHN,4,42,"They said to the woman, ""We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is indeed the Savior of the world.""","Bhamugambhira orinya omukazi,  ''Nitwesiga timubhigambho bhyawe,kubha itwe bhenyewe tuhurire,  na ati nitumanya niwe omurokozi  wensi.''"
184565803,JHN,4,43,"After those two days, he departed from there for Galilee.","Ebhiro bhibhili kibhyarabhireho, akagenda kuja Galilaya."
184565804,JHN,4,44,For Jesus himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country.,Kubha wenene akabha arangire kubha omusururirwa nakunirwa omunsi yawenene.
184565805,JHN,4,45,"When he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all the things that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival, for they had also gone to the festival.","Kiyeizire kuruga Galilaya, Abhagalilaya bhakamunyegeza.Bhakabha bhabhweine ebhinyu bhyona ebhiyakozire Yerusalemu omubhiro bhikuru, obhwokubha na bhonene bhaka bhari omuchiro chikuru."
184565806,JHN,4,46,"Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. There was a certain royal official whose son in Capernaum was ill.",Akeija emara endijo omuri Kana ya Galilaya ahidura ameizi kubha amarwa. Akabha ariyo omuafisa omo eyabheire eine omwana arweire okwo Kapernaumu.
184565807,JHN,4,47,"When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to Jesus and asked him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.","Kiyahurire Yesu yaruga Judea kuja Garilaya, akagenda owa Yesu kumutagiriza ashuke amwichise omwanawe, akabha arikake kufa."
184565808,JHN,4,48,"Jesus then said to him, ""Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.""","Niho yesu yamugambhire, ''Imwe kimutabhweine ebhinkukora ne ebhyokutinisa timwakwesiga."
184565809,JHN,4,49,"The royal official said to him, ""Sir, come down before my child dies.""","Omwebhembhezi agambha, ''Mukamaa oje ahansi omwana wange atakafire.''"
184565810,JHN,4,50,"Jesus said to him, ""Go. Your son lives."" The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went away.","Yesu amugambhira, ''Ogende omwana wawe eine obhurora.''Ogwo omuntu akesiga echigambho echiyagambhire Yesu ayegendera."
184565811,JHN,4,51,"While he was going down, his servants met him, saying that his son was living.","Kiyabheire nasubhayo ,abhakozi bhawenene bhamutangirira bhamugambhira  omwana wawe yeichize."
184565812,JHN,4,52,"So he asked them the hour when he began to improve. They replied to him, ""Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.""","Abhabhaza ni kanyaki akiyeichamu.Bhamuhorora, ''Nyeigoro omumuda gwe esaa mushanju omuriro gukamuteisura.''"
184565813,JHN,4,53,"Then the father realized that it was at that hour that Jesus had said to him, ""Your son lives."" So he himself and his whole household believed.","Niho ise yamanyire kubha na akanya konene yesu akiyagambhire, ''Omwana wawe yeichize.' Chityo wenene no oruzaro rwa wenene bhakesiga."
184565814,JHN,4,54,This was the second sign that Jesus did when he came out of Judea to Galilee.,Echi chikamanyisa kubha no omuujiza gwa kabhiri yesu oguyakora kiyarugire Yudea kuja Galilaya.
184569857,JHN,5,1,"After this there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","Kibhamazire akabha ariyo echirochikulu cha Abhayuda, na Yesu agenda Yerusalemu."
184569858,JHN,5,2,"Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate there is a pool, which in the Aramaic language is called Bethesda, and it has five roofed porches.","Nokwo Yerusalemu akabha ariyo  ebhinika amuryango ge entama, akabha nietwa omukugambha kwe Ekiebrania  Bethzatha, naryo rine ebhichweka bhitano."
184569859,JHN,5,3,"A large number of people who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed were lying there.

184569861,JHN,5,5,A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.,Omuntu omo eyabheire arweire omukanya ke emyaka gasatu na munana akabha aryaho.
184569862,JHN,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lying there, and after he realized that he had been there a long time, he said to him, ""Do you want to be healthy?""","Yesu kiyamubhweine anyamire hao kiyamanyire kubha abheireho akanya keingi Yesu amugambhira, ''Isi noyenda kwicha?''"
184569863,JHN,5,7,"The sick man replied, ""Sir, I do not have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. When I come, another steps down before me.""","Ogwo omurweire amuorora, ''Mukama tinyine muntu, wakunta mubhinika omukanya ka ameizi kutabhangurwa.

184569864,JHN,5,8,"Jesus said to him, ""Get up, take up your bed, and walk.""","Yesu amugambhira, ''Imuka okwate egodoro yawe ogende.''"
184569865,JHN,5,9,"Immediately the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked. Now that day was a Sabbath.","Aho omuntu ogwo ehicha, akata ebhinyamiro bhya wenene agenda. Chikabha chiri chiro cheirimansi."
184569866,JHN,5,10,"So the Jews said to him who was healed, ""It is the Sabbath and you are not permitted to carry your mat.""","Abhayuda bhamugambhira ogwo eyeichiswa, ''Chirechi neirimansi, tichiseine kueka egodoro yawe.''"
184569867,JHN,5,11,"He replied, ""He who made me healthy said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'""","Ahorora, wenene eyanyisicha niwe yangambhira, ''Kwata egodoro yawe ogende.''"
184569868,JHN,5,12,"They asked him, ""Who is the man that said to you, 'Pick it up and walk'?""","Bhabhaza, ''Nohi eyakugambhira 'Kwata egodoro yawe ogende?'''"
184569869,JHN,5,13,"However, the one who was healed did not know who it was because Jesus had gone away secretly, for there was a crowd in the place.","Tiwakumanya, orinya eyeichiswe taramumanyire, kubha yesu akarugaho omukwesereka. Kubha akabha ariho abhantu bheingi omuchichweka echo."
184569870,JHN,5,14,"Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, ""See, you have become healthy! Do not sin anymore, so that something worse will not happen to you.""","Kibharugiraho Yesu amusanga orinya omuntu omukanisa amugambhira, ''Rebha,weicha! ''Otarikora bhibhi bhundi oteija okatangwana ebhibhi kusaga.''"
184569871,JHN,5,15,The man went away and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him healthy.,Orinya omuntu agenda agambhira Abhayuda kubha Yesu niwe yamwichisa.
184569872,JHN,5,16,"Now because of these things the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the Sabbath.","Abhwebhintu ebhyo Abhayuda bhakamuangaisha Yesu, kubha ngu akakora ebhintu ebhyo omwirimansi."
184569873,JHN,5,17,"Jesus replied to them, ""My Father is working even now, and I, too, am working.""","Yesu abhagambhira, ''Tata wange nakora emirimo mpaka ati nanye nikora emirimo.''"
184569874,JHN,5,18,"Because of this, the Jews sought even more to kill him because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.","Abhwensonga ejo Abhayuda bhakongera kumuiga bhabhase kumwita tikwita irimansi, nanokweta Katonda Tata wa wenene, kwekora nasana Katonda."
184569875,JHN,5,19,"Jesus answered them, ""Truly, truly, the Son can do nothing of himself, except only what he sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father is doing, the Son does in the same way.","Yesu ahorora, ''Mumanye, mumanye, Omwana takukora chintu echatabhweine ise nakola, kubha chona chona Tata echakukora nicho nomwana akukora."
184569876,JHN,5,20,"For the Father loves the Son and he shows him everything that he himself does, and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be amazed.","Kubha Tata eine egonzi amwanawe, namwereka bhurichintu echakukora najakumweraka ebhintu bhihango kusaga ebhi mugenderere kurangara.''"
184569877,JHN,5,21,"For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to anyone he wishes.","Nko kwo Tata azikura abhafu nokubhaha obhurora, omugeri echo omwana nawe naha wena wena owakwenda."
184569878,JHN,5,22,"For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son","Kubha Tata naramura wenawena, bado amueire omwana kuramura kwona"
184569879,JHN,5,23,so that everyone will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.,Abhase kukunirwa na bhona omwana nkwo Omwana okwa kukunira Tata. Wenene atakukunira omwana takukunira na Tata eyamutumire.
184569880,JHN,5,24,"Truly, truly, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, but he has passed from death to life.","Yesige, yesige, wena wena akuurira echigambho change no okwesiga wenene eyantumire eine obhurora obhutariwaho tariramurwa.

184569881,JHN,5,25,"""Truly, truly, I tell you the time is coming, and is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.","Yesige, yesige, nimbhagambhira akanya nkajakugobha abhafu mbhajakuurira eiraka ryo Omwana wa Katonda, na bhona abharahurira bharagira obhurora."
184569882,JHN,5,26,"For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has also given to the Son so that he has life in himself,","Nko kwo chiri Tata eine obhurora omunda yawenene wenka,"
184569883,JHN,5,27,and the Father has given the Son authority to carry out judgment because he is the Son of Man.,"Amuheire omwana kugira obhurora omundaye, na Tata amueire omwana ejubhuro abhase kuramura  kubha no omwana wa Adamu."
184569884,JHN,5,28,"Do not be amazed at this, for there is a time coming in which everyone who is in the tombs will hear his voice","Mutasobhezwa nechi, kubha akanya nkajakwija abhafu bhona abharyomubhituro mbhajakuhurira  eiraka rya wenene"
184569885,JHN,5,29,"and will come out: those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.","nabho mbhajakuja aheru: abhakozire ebhirungi okuzikurwa okutawaho,na abhakozire ebhibhi okuzikurwa okwo kuramurwa."
184569886,JHN,5,30,"""I can do nothing from myself. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me.","Timubhasa kukora chintu chona chona kuruga omuri nyawe nyeka.

184569887,JHN,5,31,"If I should testify about myself, my testimony would not be true.","Kidayejurira inye, obhujurizi bhwange tibhweine mazima."
184569888,JHN,5,32,"There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony that he gives about me is true.",Ariyo ondijo akujurira ahali nyawe nimanya obhujurizi obhwakujurira na amazima.

184569890,JHN,5,34,But the testimony that I receive is not from man. I say these things that you might be saved.,"Chiri chiti, obhujulizi obhwokubhona tibhukuruga amuntu. Nigambha ebhi mubhase kurokorwa."
184569891,JHN,5,35,"John was a lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice in his light for a while.","Yohana akabha aryetara ekabha neyaka no okumeremeta, mkabha mwenzre kujisemererwa omukanya kake omusana gwawenene."
184569892,JHN,5,36,"Yet the testimony that I have is greater than that of John, for the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me that the Father has sent me.","Okujurira okwonyine nikuhango kusaga okwa Yohana, emirimo Tata eyampeire kumara, ezo emirimo ezinkukora nizijuliza nko kwo Tata atumire."
184569893,JHN,5,37,The Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You have neither heard his voice nor seen his form at any time.,Tata atumire wenenen najurira ajurire ahali nyawe. Timukahuriraga eiraka ryawenene nokurebha okwakozire akanya konakona.

184569902,JHN,5,46,"If you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me.","Kimwakubheire nimwesiga Musa, mwakwesigire nanye kubha akahandika ebhigambho bhyange."

184573953,JHN,6,1,"After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also called the Sea of Tiberias.","Ebhyo kibhyaweire, Yesu akagenda orubhaju rwe enyanja Galilaya, neyetwa enyanja ya Tiberia."
184573954,JHN,6,2,A great crowd was following him because they saw the signs that he was doing on those who were sick.,Embhaga mpango ekabha nemuondera obhwokubha bhakarebha echiyakozire abharweire.

184573966,JHN,6,14,"Then, when the people saw this sign that he did, they said, ""This truly is the prophet who is to come into the world.""","Obhwo abhantu kibhabhweine ebhyakozire bhakagambha, ''Mazima ogu niwe omusururirwa areija omunsi.''"
184573967,JHN,6,15,"When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the mountain by himself.","Yesu kiyamanyire  kubha bhakabha mubhenda kumukwata bhakukore kubha omukama wabho, aketawenka, ashubha agenda omukabhanga wenene wenka."
184573968,JHN,6,16,"When it became evening, his disciples went down to the sea.","Kiryabheire bhweigoro, abhegesibhwa bhakagenda ahanyanja."
184573969,JHN,6,17,"They got into a boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was dark by this time, and Jesus had not yet come to them.",Bhakaja omubhwato bhakabha mubhagenda Kapernaumu. (Rikabha niritobhera Yesu akabha atakeizire omuri bhonene).

184573971,JHN,6,19,"When they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.","Aho abhegesibhwa kibhabheire bhateire egashya nkagabhiri neitano anga gasatu, bhabhona Yesu natamuka ahiguru ye enyanja ei no obhwato,bhatina."
184573972,JHN,6,20,"But he said to them, ""It is I! Do not be afraid.""","Chonka abhagambhira, ''Ninye mutatina.''"
184573973,JHN,6,21,"Then they were willing to receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land where they were going.","Bhakabha bhayetegire kumutora omubhwato, obhwato bhugobha omunsi ehibhabheire nibhenda kuja."
184573974,JHN,6,22,"The next day, the crowd that had been standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone.","Echiro chahondereho, ebhaga ekabha eyemereire arubhaju rwe enyanja bhakarebha atariho bhwato bhundi sana bhurinya obhu Yesu na abhegesibhwa bha wenene bhakabha bhatakahanamire chonka abhegesibhwa bha wenene bhakabha bhatakahanamire bhakabha bhagenzire kuchara."
184573975,JHN,6,23,"However, there were some boats that came from Tiberias close to the place where they had eaten the bread loaves after the Lord had given thanks.","(Sana, akabha ariho obhwato obhwarugire Tiberia akabha ateine na ahibharirire emigate Mukama obhuyatoire orusimo)."
184573976,JHN,6,24,"When the crowd discovered that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.","Akanya ke ebhaga kumanya kubha ti Yesu nanga abhegesibhwa bha wenene bhakabha bharikurinya, bhonene bhakahanama omubhwato bhagenda Kapernaumu mbhaiga Yesu."
184573977,JHN,6,25,"After they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, ""Rabbi, when did you come here?""","Kibhamazire kumubhona omurubhaju orundi oryenyanja bhamubhaza, ''Rabhi okeija ryari kunu?''"
184573978,JHN,6,26,"Jesus replied to them, saying, ""Truly, truly, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate some of the bread loaves and were filled.","Yesu abhahorora, abhagambhira, Yesige, yesige, nimuiga nyawe, tikwambha mkabhona ebhinakozire."
184573979,JHN,6,27,"Do not labor for the food that perishes, but labor for the food that endures to eternal life which the Son of Man will give you, for God the Father has set his seal on him.""","Reka kukorera omurimo echakurya echokufa,

184573980,JHN,6,28,"Then they said to him, ""What must we do, so that we may do the works of God?""","Bhamugambhira, ''Ne echiki echituseine kukora kubhasa kukora omurimo gwa Katonda?''"
184573981,JHN,6,29,"Jesus replied and said to them, ""This is the work of God: That you believe in the one whom he has sent.""","Yesu ahorora, ''Ogu nigwo omurimo gwa Katonda:mwesige wenene ohuyatwekire.''"
184573982,JHN,6,30,"So they said to him, ""What sign then will you do, so that we may see and believe you? What will you do?","Bhamugambhira, ''Isi nojakwerekaki echorakola, kubha nitubhasa kurebha no okukwesiga Nojakukoraki?"

184573987,JHN,6,35,"Jesus said to them, ""I am the bread of life; he who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.","Yesu abhagambhira, ''Nyawe ninye omugate gwo obhurora, wena wena akwija ahalinye taribhona njara na wena wena akunyesiga taribhona hiriho omukanya kona.''"

So there was a division among them.","Abhafarisayo abhandi bhakagambha, ''Omuntu ogu tararugire wa Katonda orwokubha takukwata echiro che eirimansi.

184586257,JHN,9,17,"So they asked the blind man again, ""What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?"" The blind man said, ""He is a prophet.""","Bhasubha bhamubhaza ogwo eyabheire atakurebha, ''Nogambhao ota ahali wenene obhwokubha yakomorora ameso gawe?'' Atakurebha agambha, ''No omusururirwa.''"
184586258,JHN,9,18,Now the Jews still did not believe about him that he was blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him who had received his sight.,Mpaka akanya ako abhayuda tibharabhasize kumwesiga kwambha akabha atakurebha yabhasa kurebha mpaka aibhareteire abhazeire bha wenene wenene eyabhweine kurebha.
184586259,JHN,9,19,"They asked the parents, ""Is this your son whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?""","Bhakabhabhaza abhazeire, Isi, ogu nomwana wanyu oumukugambha kwambha akazarwa atakurebha? abhasize ata kurebha?''"
184586260,JHN,9,20,"So his parents answered them, ""We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.","Obhwo abhazeire bha wenene bhamuorora, ''Nitumanya kwambha ogu nomwana weitu akazarwa atakurebha."
184586261,JHN,9,21,"How he now sees, we do not know, and who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him, he is an adult. He can speak for himself.""","Kubha ati narebha, titukumanya, na wenene amukozire arebhe, titukumumanya. Mumubhaze wenene. Nomuntu mukuru. Nabhasa kwegambhirira wenene.''"
184586262,JHN,9,22,"His parents said these things, because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess him to be the Christ, he would be thrown out of the synagogue.","Abhazeire bha wenene bhakagambha ebhintu ebhyo, kubha bhakatina Abhayuda. kubha Abhayuda bhakabha bharamwire kukora, wena wena areikiriza kugambha Yesu ni Kristo, najakwangwa ne ekanisa."
184586263,JHN,9,23,"Because of this, his parents said, ""He is an adult, ask him.""","Arwechi, abhazeire bha wenene bhakagambha, ''Nomuntu mukuru, mumubhaze wenene.''"
184586264,JHN,9,24,"So for a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, ""Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.""","Bhamweta omurudi gwa kabhiri,bhamweta ogwo omuntu eyabheire atarikurebha bhamugambhira, ""Omue echitinisa Katonda. Nitumanya omuntu ogu eine entambhara.''"
184586265,JHN,9,25,"Then that man replied, ""I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see.""","Nibhwo muntu ogwo yahoroire, ""Abhe yeine entambhara, yawe tikumanya. Echintu chimo echikumanya:kinabheire ntakurebha, ati nidebha.''"

184594459,JHN,11,27,"She said to him, ""Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.""","Amugambhira, ''Nikwo, Mukama niyesiga kwabha iwe ni Kristo, Omwana wa Katonda, wenene akwija omunsi.''"
184594460,JHN,11,28,"When she had said this, she went away and called her sister Mary privately. She said, ""The Teacher is here and is calling for you.""","Kiyamazire kugambha echo, akegendera ayeta ayetamukuru wa mariamu aheserekire. Agambha, ''Omwegesa aryaha nakweta.''"
184594461,JHN,11,29,"When she heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.","Mariamu kiyaurire ebhyo, akeimuka bhwangu agenda owa Yesu."
184594462,JHN,11,30,Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him.,"Na Yesu akabha atakeizire omu charo, sana akabha achali echichweka chiyatangweine Martha."
184594463,JHN,11,31,"So when the Jews, who were with her in the house and who were comforting her, saw Mary getting up quickly and going out, they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.","Nibhwo abhayuda abhabheire bheine mariamu omunju na bharinya abhabheire mbhamurundana,
Kibhamubhweine nemuka bhwangu  kuja aeru,bhakamuondera; bhakamanya kwambha nagenda achituro kuririla okwo."
184594464,JHN,11,32,"When Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, ""Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.""","Niho Mariamu, kiyagobhire arinya Yesu aiyabheire ali akamubhona, ""Mukama, kubha wabheire oryaha, murumuna wange tiyakufire.''"
184594465,JHN,11,33,"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and was troubled;","Yesu kiyamubhweine narira, na abhayuda abheizire amo na wenene bhakabha nibharira, akasasira omumutima akashasha;"
184594466,JHN,11,34,"he said, ""Where have you laid him?"" They said to him, ""Lord, come and see.""","agambha, ""Mwamunyamika nkai? bhamugambhira, Mukama, ija orebhe.''"
184594467,JHN,11,35,Jesus wept.,Yesu arila.
184594468,JHN,11,36,"Then the Jews said, ""See how much he loved Lazarus!""","Abhayuda bhakagambha, Rebha okwoyabheire nayenda Lazaro!''"
184594469,JHN,11,37,"But some of them said, ""Could not this man, who opened the eyes of a blind man, also have made this man not die?""","Chonka  abhandi omuri bhonene akagambha, ""tiwogu, eyakomoroire ameiso go omuntu eyabheire atakurebha, yaremwa kumukora atafa?''"
184594470,JHN,11,38,"Then Jesus again, being deeply moved in himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.","Obhwo yesu, akabha nasasa omunda ya wenene,agenda achituro. rukabha ruri orusa, neibhare likabha liteirwe ahiguru ye echituro."
184594471,JHN,11,39,"Jesus said, ""Take away the stone."" Martha, the sister of Lazarus, the one who had died, said to Jesus, ""Lord, by this time the body will be decaying, for he has been dead for four days.""","Yesu agambha, Mwiyeho eibhare. ''Martha, munyaya wa Lazaro, wenene eyafire, amugambhira Yesu,Mukama, omukanya aka, omubhili niguja kubha gwafile, orwokubha echi nechiro cha kana.''"
184594472,JHN,11,40,"Jesus said to her, ""Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?""","Yesu amugambhira, ''Nyawe tidabhagambhire kwambha, kimurayesiga, nimujakubhona echitinisa cha Katonda?''"
184594473,JHN,11,41,"So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, ""Father, I thank you that you listened to me.","Bheyaho ebhare ,Yesu  arebha ahiguru agambha, ''Tata, nikusima obhwokubha nourikiliza."
184594474,JHN,11,42,"I knew that you always listen to me, but it is because of the crowd that is standing around me that I said this, so that they may believe that you have sent me.""","Nimanya nopurikiliza ebhiro bhyona, chonka arwensonga  ye ebhaga  eyemereire  ezigatire nagambha ebhi, ili bhabhase kwesiga kugira gu iwe otumire.''"
184594475,JHN,11,43,"After he had said this, he cried out with a loud voice, ""Lazarus, come out!""","Kiyamazire kugambha ebhyo, akarira neiraka riyango, ''Lazaro, ija aeru!''"
184594476,JHN,11,44,"The dead man came out; his feet and hands were bound with cloths, and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said to them, ""Untie him and let him go.""","Omufu akeija aeru akomire emikono na amaguru akomeise esanda ezokuzikiramu, no obhuso bhwa wenene bhukabha bhukomire ne echitambhara. ''Yesu amugambhira,
''Mukomorore mumureke agende.''"
184594477,JHN,11,45,"Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.","Abhayuda bheingi bhakeija ahali Mariamu bharebha Yesu echiyakozire, bhakamwesiga;"
184594478,JHN,11,46,But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.,Chonka abhandi bhakagenda omubhafarisayo bhabhagambhira ebhintu ebhiyakozire Yesu.
184594479,JHN,11,47,"Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council together and said, ""What will we do? This man does many signs.","Abhakuru bha amakuhani na amafarisayo bherundana amo omurubharaza bhagambha,
''Tukoreki? Omuntu ogu nayereka bhingi."
184594480,JHN,11,48,"If we leave him alone like this, all will believe in him; the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.""","Kituramureka tuti wenene wenka,bhona mbhajakumwesiga; Abharoma mbheija kutwara bhyona ne echichweka chitu ne eiyanga ryeitu.''"
184594481,JHN,11,49,"However, a certain man among them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, ""You know nothing.","Nangu chityo, omuntu omo omuri bhonene, Kayafa, eyabheire ari kuhani omukuru omwaka ogwo, amugambhira,"" Timukumanya chona chona ."
184594482,JHN,11,50,"You do not consider that it is better for you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes.""",Timukutekereza kwambha chiseine arwanyu  omuntu omo aseine kufa abhwa abhantu  kuriko eiyanga ryona kufafarikana.''
184594483,JHN,11,51,"Now this he said not from himself. Instead, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;","Ebhi torabhigambhire abhwesonga ya wenene, sana, arwokubha akabha ari kuhani omukuru omwaka gurinya, akarekwa kwambha Yesu neija kufa  abhweiyanga;"
184594484,JHN,11,52,"and not only for the nation, but so that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered together into one.","na tikwaiyanga ryonka, sana yesu abhone kubharundana abhana bha Katonda abhenaganagire ebhichweka chweka."
184594485,JHN,11,53,So from that day onward they planned how to put Jesus to death.,Kubhandiza echiro echo nokugenderera bhateka teka okwobharamwita Yesu.
184594486,JHN,11,54,"No longer did Jesus walk openly among the Jews, but he departed from there into the country near to the wilderness into a town called Ephraim. There he stayed with the disciples.","Yesu akabha atachitambhuka  nayezora omubhayuda, sana akagenda omuchigo echabhweire chiri ei neirungu  omuchigo cha Efraimu. Aho akeikaryo na abhegesibhwa."
184594487,JHN,11,55,"Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover in order to purify themselves.","Pasaka ya Abhayuda ekabha yeizire kugobha, nabhandi bhagenda Yerusalemu aeru ye echigo Pasaka etakagobhire ili bhabhase kusabha obhuganyizi bhonene."
184594488,JHN,11,56,"They were looking for Jesus and speaking one with another as they stood in the temple: ""What do you think? That he will not come to the festival?""","Bhakabha nibhamuiga Yesu, bhafumora bhuryomo kibhabheire bhemereire omukanisa,
''Nimutekerezaki? Kugira ngu najakwija omuchiro chikuru?''"
184594489,JHN,11,57,"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given an order that if anyone knew where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might seize him.","Akanya ako abhakuru bha amakuhani na amafarisayo bhakabha bhateireo omuango wena aramanya Yesu ahali, asanire kutugambira tubhase kumukwata."
184598529,JHN,12,1,"Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.","Ebhilo mukaga epasaka etakagobhire, Yesu akagenda Bhethania, aiyabheire ali Lazaro, wenene ohuyazikwire kuruga omubhafu."
184598530,JHN,12,2,"So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those who were lying down at the table with Jesus.","Bhamuchumbhira echakurya chabhweigoro okwo, na Martha amukorera, akanya ako Lazaro akabha aryomo omuri bharinya abhasitamire kurya amo na Yesu."
184598531,JHN,12,3,"Then Mary took a litra of perfume made of very precious pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.","Mariamu akwata echupa ya amajuta agakozirwe na nardo ndungi, ekusera muno, amusiga yesu amaguru, amuragaza amaguru ne eisoke rya wenene; enju yona ekeijura eharufu ya amajuta."
184598532,JHN,12,4,"Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would betray him, said,","Yuda isikarioti, omo omubhegesibhwa bha wenene, niwe arayanga Yesu,akagambha,"
184598533,JHN,12,5,"""Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?""",''Kubhaki amajuta aga gataguzwa edinari bhisatu bhakaebhwa abheine ebhyetago?''
184598534,JHN,12,6,"Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. He had the moneybag and would steal from what was put in it.","Nawe akagambha ebhyo, tikubhasasibhwa abheine ebhyetago, sana obhwesonga akabha aryomusuma: wenene niwe yabheire nabhika amaera akabha natwara ebhyabheire nibhitwamu omwo abhwa wenene."
184598535,JHN,12,7,"Jesus said, ""Allow her to keep what she has for the day of my burial.","Yesu akagambha, Mureka ateo echeine  abhwe echiro cho kuzika nyawe."
184598536,JHN,12,8,"You will always have the poor with you. But you will not always have me.""",Abhokwetaga nimujakubhagira ebhiro bhyona; chonka timuringira bhiro bhyona.''
184598537,JHN,12,9,"Now a large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came, not only for Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.","Ebhaga nyingi ya Abhayuda bhakamanya kwambha Yesu aryokwo, nabho bhakeija, tgi bhwa Yesu wenka, ila no okumubhona lazaro owo Yesu yaibhwirwe kuruga omubhafu."
184598538,JHN,12,10,The chief priests conspired together so that they might also put Lazarus to death;,Nabho abhakuru bha amakuhani bhafomoraho ili bhabhase  kumwita Lazaro;
184598539,JHN,12,11,for it was because of him that many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.,Abhwa wenene bheingi  omubhayuda  bhakegendera kandi bhesiga Yesu.
184598540,JHN,12,12,"On the next day a great crowd came to the festival. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,","Echiro cha kabhiri ebhaga mpango ekeija omu chiro chikuru. Kibhaurire kwambha Yesu neija Yerusalemu,"
184598541,JHN,12,13,"they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out, ""Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.""","Bhakatwara amabhabhi ge emiti ye emitende bhasoora aeru bhagenda kumutangirira bhatera eduru, ''Hosana!Eine emigisha wenene akwija abhwe eibhara rya Mukama, Omukama wa Isiraeli.''"
184598542,JHN,12,14,"Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it was written,","Yesu akakwasa omwa gwe - epunda ajianama; nko kwo chaandikirwe,"
184598543,JHN,12,15,"""Do not fear, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, sitting on the colt of a donkey.""","''Otatina, mwisiki wa Sayuni; rebha, Omukama wawe neija, ahanamire omwana gwe-epunda.''"
184598544,JHN,12,16,"His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.","Abhegesibhwa bhawenene tibharamanyire ebhintu ebhyo obhwo; chonka Yesu kiyaebhirwe echitinisa, nibhwo bheijukire kwambha ebhintu ebhi bhikaandikwa abhwa wenene na bhakora ebhintu ebhi ahali wenene."
184598545,JHN,12,17,Now the crowd testified that they had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead.,"Erinya ebhaga ya abhantu eyabheire erihamo na Yesu akanya ki yayesire Lazaro kuruga omuchituro, bhajurira omubhandi."
184598546,JHN,12,18,"It was also for this reason that the crowd went out to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign.",Chikabha aabhwesoga ye ebhaga ya bhantu bhakagenda  kumutangirira arwesonga bhakaurira  kwambha yakora ebhintu ebhyo.
184598547,JHN,12,19,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, ""Look, you can do nothing good; see, the world has gone after him.""","Abhafarisayo bhafumora bhonenee kwa bhonene, ""Rebha, ati timubhasa kukora chona chona; rebha, enssi yaja owawenene."""
184598548,JHN,12,20,Now certain Greeks were among those who were going up to worship at the festival.,Bhake abhayunani  bhakabha bhari omuri bharinya abhabheire mubhaja kweongera omuchiro chikuru.
184598549,JHN,12,21,"These went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, ""Sir, we want to see Jesus.""","Abho bhakamugendera Filipo, eyarugire Bethsaida eya Galilaya, bhamusabha nibhaagambha, ""Mukama, itwe nitwendakumurebha Yesu.''"
184598550,JHN,12,22,"Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip, and they told Jesus.",Filipo agenda amugambhira Andrea; Andrea na Filipo bhagenda bhamugambhira Yesu.
184598551,JHN,12,23,"Jesus answered them and said, ""The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.","Yesu abhaorora agambha, ""Akanya kagobha akomwana wa Adamu kuebhwa echitinisa."
184598552,JHN,12,24,"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, it will bear much fruit.","Yesige, yesige, nibhagambhira, embhegu ye egano ketagwire omunsi ekafa, neikara etyo, sana kekufa nezara ebhirabha bhingi."
184598553,JHN,12,25,He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.,Wenene akwenda obhurora bhwa  wenene najakubhubhuza; sana wenene akwanga obhurorabha wenene  omwiyanga eri neija kureta obhurora bhutawaho.
184598554,JHN,12,26,"If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.","Omuntu wena wena kakukorere nyawe, apondere; nanye ahindi, nio no omukozi wange arabhari. Omuntu wena wena kakunkorera, Tata neija kumukunira."
184598555,JHN,12,27,"Now my soul is troubled and what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.",Ati omutima gwange gwatina:nanye ngambhe nta?Chonka narwechi  nagobha akanya aka.
184598556,JHN,12,28,"Father, glorify your name."" Then a voice came from heaven and said, ""I have glorified it and I will glorify it again.""","Tata, Singiza eibhara ryawe.'' Eiraka rija kuruga omwiguru  nirigambha, ""Narisingiza nanye narisingiza akandi.''"
184598557,JHN,12,29,"Then the crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, ""An angel has spoken to him.""","Ebhaga eyayemereire ehi na wenene bhaurira,

184598558,JHN,12,30,"Jesus answered and said, ""This voice did not come for me, but for you.","Yesu ahorora nagambha, Eiraka eli tiryeija abhwange, sana abhwanyu."
184598559,JHN,12,31,Now is the judgment of this world: Now will the ruler of this world be thrown out.,Ati okuramurwa kwe ensi eji elio: Ati omukuru wensi eji neija kunagwa aheru.
184598560,JHN,12,32,"When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself.""","Nanye kindemuchwa aiguru yensi, ninyija kubhanyurura bhona owange.''"
184598561,JHN,12,33,He said this to indicate what kind of death he would die.,Akabhigambha ebhi nayereka orufu  rwengeri eyaraferamu.
184598562,JHN,12,34,"The crowd answered him, ""We have heard from the law that the Christ will stay forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?""","Ebhaga emuorora, ""Itwe tuurire omumuku ya kwambha kristo neija kwikarayo eira ryona. Neiwe wakugambha ota, 'Omwana wa Adamu chiseine kwimuchwa ahiguru'?"
184598563,JHN,12,35,"Jesus then said to them, ""The light will still be with you for a short amount of time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.","Yesu abhagambhira, ""Omusana kigukubha guri amo neimwe omwanya guke.Genda obhwokubha mwine omusana,ili omwirima guteija gukabhabhasa.Wenene akugenda omumwirima takumanya akuja."
184598564,JHN,12,36,"While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be sons of light."" Jesus said these things and then departed and hid from them.","Nimurabha mwine omusana,yesige omusana ogwo mbhase kubha abhana bho omusana."" Yesu akagambha ebhi  asubha ayegendera  ayesereka tibharamubhweine."
184598565,JHN,12,37,"Although Jesus had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him","Ingawa Yesu akereka bhingi engeri eji omumeiso gabho, chonka tibharamwesigire"
184598566,JHN,12,38,"so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled, in which he said: ""Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?""","Ili chigobhe echigambho cho omusururirwa Isaya, akagambha: ""Mukama, noi eyaikirize ebhigambho bhyeitu? No omukono gwa Mukama ashururirwohi?''"
184598567,JHN,12,39,"For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah had also said,","Eji niyo esonga bhonene tibharayesigire, obhwo Isaya akagambha,"
184598568,JHN,12,40,"""He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their heart, otherwise they would see with their eyes and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.""","''Abhaumise amaiso, ajikozire kugumangana emitima yabho; bhateija bhakarebha na amaiso gabho bhakamanya  omumitima yabho, bhakechuza nanye nkabhechisa.''"
184598569,JHN,12,41,Isaiah said these things because he saw the glory of Jesus and spoke of him.,Isaya akagambha ebhigambho arwokubha akabhona echitinisa cha Yesu agambha ebhigambho bhya wenene.
184598570,JHN,12,42,"But despite that, many of the rulers believed in Jesus; but because of the Pharisees, they did not confess it so that they would not be banned from the synagogue.","Chonka, nabhakuru bheingi bhakamwesiga Yesu; Chonka abhwa Amafarisayo, tibhareikirize bhateija kwangwa ne ekanisa."
184598571,JHN,12,43,They loved the glory that comes from people more than the glory that comes from God.,Bhakenda bhabhonwe na abhantu kusaga ebherwa ezokuruga owa Katonda.
184598572,JHN,12,44,"Jesus cried out and said, ""The one who believes in me believes not only in me but also in him who sent me,","Yesu atugura eiraka nagambha,''Wena akunyesiga nyawe ,takwesiga nyawe nyenka sana norinya eyantumire,"
184598573,JHN,12,45,and the one who sees me sees him who sent me.,Nawe akubhona nyawe nabhona orinya eyantumire.
184598574,JHN,12,46,"I have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.",Nyawe nkeija nko omusana omunsi ili bhuri muntu aranyesiga nyawe ateikara mumwirima.
184598575,JHN,12,47,"If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.","Karabha omuntu wena wena araulira ebhigambho bhyange chonka atabhikwasire, nyawe tikumuramura; obhwokubha tindeizire kuramura ensi, sana ndokore ensi."
184598576,JHN,12,48,The one who rejects me and who does not receive my words has one who judges him. The word I have spoken will judge him on the last day.,"Wena akunyanga nyawe atakwikiriza ebhigambho bhyange, eine aramuramura: echigambho echi echagambhirwe niryo rilamuramura echiro che ezindo."
184598577,JHN,12,49,"For I did not speak for myself, but it is the Father who sent me, who has given me the command about what to say and what to speak.","Kubha nyawe tindagambhire obhwo omutima gwange  gwonka. Sana ni Tata eyantweire, wenene wenka adagirire ebhindabbaragira nebhindagabha."
184598578,JHN,12,50,"I know that his command is eternal life, so that is what I say—just as the Father has spoken to me, so I speak.""","Nanye nimanya  okuragira kwa wenene  no obhurora obhutawaho; ebhyo ebhikugambha nyawe -nko kwo Tata yadagirire,nibhyo ebhindikugambha omuri bhonene.''"
184602625,JHN,13,1,"Now it was before the Festival of the Passover. Jesus knew that his hour had come to go out of this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.","Kichabheire chitakabheire chiro chikuru cha pasaka, orwokubha Yesu akamanya akanya ka wenene kagobhire kuruga omunsi kugenda owa tata, kiyabheire abhenzire abhantu bha wenene abhabheire bhari omunsi, akabhenda obhuruga."
184602626,JHN,13,2,"Now the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot son of Simon to betray Jesus. So during dinner,","Na ibhilisi akabha yateirwemu omumutima gwa Yuda Isikarioti, omwana wa Simoni, kumwaga Yesu."
184602627,JHN,13,3,Jesus—who knew that the Father had given everything over into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God—,Yesu akamanya kwambha Tata ateiremu bhuri chintu  omumikono yawenene na arugire owa Katonda.
184602628,JHN,13,4,got up from dinner and took off his outer clothing. Then he took a towel and wrapped it around himself.,Akeimuka achakurya ayara echijwaro cha wenene ahansi echijwaro chaeru.Akwata etauro ayekoma wenene.
184602629,JHN,13,5,Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and dry them with the towel that he had put around himself.,Asubha ateka ameizi omubhakuri asubha abhanza kubhoja amaguru abhegesibhwa bha wenene abharagaza ne etauro eiyabheire ayekomire.

184610840,JHN,15,24,"If I had not done the works that no one else did among them, they would have no sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.","Kidabha tikozire omurimo omuri bhonene  tariyo nomo eyakozire, bhakubheire bhateine ntambhara;
Chonka bhakozire bhyona bhibhili bhabhweine kandi bhantamirwe nyawe na Tata wange."
184610841,JHN,15,25,"But this is in order to fulfill the word that is written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'",Echi nichizoka ili echigabho chigobheserezwe echahandikirwe omumuku gwabho: 'Nibhantamwa nyawe bhateine nsongs.'
184610842,JHN,15,26,"When the Comforter comes—whom I will send to you from the Father, that is, the Spirit of truth, who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.","Akanya ko omuganyizi kareija, oundatweka omuri imwe kuruga owa Tata, ogu niwe, Mwoyo wa amazima, akuruga owa Tata, najakujurira."
184610843,JHN,15,27,"You also must testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.",Neimwe nangu nimujurira  obhwensonga  mbheire amo nanye kuruga ebhanzo.

184614914,JHN,16,2,They will throw you out of the synagogues. But the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering a service to God.,Nibhaja kubhata aeru ye esinagogi; mazima akanya nikeija obhwo bhuri arabheita  najakuteka teka kugira ngu nakora  omurimo gurungi abhwa Katonga.
184614915,JHN,16,3,They will do these things because they have not known the Father nor me.,Nibhajakubhakorera ebhintu ebhi orwensonga tibhakumumanya Tata wala tibhakumunya nyawe.
184614916,JHN,16,4,"I have spoken these things to you so that when their hour comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you about these things in the beginning, because I was with you.","Nabhagambhira ebhintu ebhiili akanya kikaragobha akebhi kurebheka, nimubhasa kwijuka no okwombhagambhire mubhase bhonene.

184614917,JHN,16,5,"But now I go to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'","Nichirabha, ati nigenda owo orinya eyantumire;
Chonka tariho omuri imwe akubhaza, ''Nojankahi?''"
184614918,JHN,16,6,"But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.","Obhwensonga ngambhire ebhigambho ebhi omuri imwe, obhusasi bhwijuire omumitima yanyu."
184614919,JHN,16,7,"But truly I tell you, it is better for you that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you.","Nangu chityo, nibhagambhira amazima: ni chirungi  omuri imwe kidangenda; Nichimanyisa kidabha ntagenzire, Arabhasasirs tareija omuri imwe; Chonka kidagenda nijakumutuma omuri imwe."
184614920,JHN,16,8,"When he comes, the Comforter will prove the world to be wrong about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment—","Kareija, ogu omuorerezi najakurabhyaho ensi 
echikwateine entambhara, echikwateine no obhugororoki ne echikwateine eiramu."
184614921,JHN,16,9,"about sin, because they do not believe in me;","Echikwasire aha ntambhara, na abhwokubha tibharanyesigire nyawe,"
184614922,JHN,16,10,"about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will no longer see me;","Echikwasire abhugororoki,obhwensonga nija owa tata, na timuribhona tena;"
184614923,JHN,16,11,"and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.",na achikwateine eiramu abhwe ensonga omukuru we ensi eji aramwirwe.
184614924,JHN,16,12,"I have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.","Nyine bhingi ebhyokubhagambhira, Chonka timwakubhimanya ati."
184614925,JHN,16,13,"But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak from himself. But he will say whatever he hears, and he will tell you things that are to come.","Chonka, wenene, Mwoyo wa amazima, kareija, najakubhebhembhera omumazima gona; kubha najakugambha  abhwa wenene wenka; Chonka chona chona echarahurira, najakubhigambha ebhintu ebhyo; na najakubhyereka umuri imwe ebhintu ebhireija."
184614926,JHN,16,14,"He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and he will tell it to you.","Wenene naja kunyesingiza nyawe, orwensonga najakutwara ebhintu bhyange na najakubhirangirira omuri imwe."
184614927,JHN,16,15,"Everything that the Father has is mine. Therefore, I said that the Spirit will take from what is mine and he will tell it to you.","Ebhintu bhyona Tata ebhyeine nebhyange; obhwo, nagambha okwo Mwoyo okwaratwara ebhintu bhyange najakubhyereka omuri imwe."
184614928,JHN,16,16,"In a short amount of time you will no longer see me, and after another short amount of time you will see me.""","Achariyo akanya kake, timuribhona tena; akanya kake kikararabhaho tena, nimujakubhona.''"
184614929,JHN,16,17,"Then some of his disciples said to one another, ""What is this that he says to us, 'A short amount of time you will no longer see me and after another short amount of time you will see me,' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?""","Bhamo abhegesibhwa bhawenene bhagambhirana, ''Nechiki echakutugambhira, Akanya kake nimujakubhona.' na, 'obhwo kubha nija owa Tata?''"
184614930,JHN,16,18,"Therefore they said, ""What is this that he says, 'A short amount of time'? We do not know what he is talking about.""","Obhwo bhagambha, ""Nichituki echakugambha ,'Yasigara akanya kake'? Titukumanya ebhyakugambha.''"
184614931,JHN,16,19,"Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, ""Is this what you are asking each other, what I meant by saying, 'In a short amount of time and you will no longer see me, and again in a short amount of time and you will see me'?","Yesu akabhana bhakabha nibhenda kumubhaza, na wenene abhagambhira, ""Nimwebhaza imwe aharwechi, okugambhire, 'Achabhuraho akanya kake, timuribhona tena; na akanya kake kikararabhao timuribhona '?"
184614932,JHN,16,20,"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will be glad. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.","Yesige, yesige, nibhagambhira, nimujakurira nokusasa, Chonka ensi nejakusemererwa nimujakwetamwa chonka obhusasi bhwanyu nejakuindurwa kubha amasemererwa."
184614933,JHN,16,21,"When a woman gives birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers her tribulation because of her joy that a man has been born into the world.","Omukazi nagira obhusasi kakubha eine okuribhwa  orwokubha akanya ko okuzara kagobhire; Chonka kakuzara omwana, takwijuka tena obhusasi orwokubha amasemererwa ga wenene omwana yazarwa omunsi."
184614934,JHN,16,22,"So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your heart will be glad, and no one will be able to take away your joy from you.","Imwe neimwe mwine amaganya ati, nijakubhabhona tena; ne emitima zanyu nizijakusemererwa na tariho arabha kwiyaho amasemererwa gange."
184614935,JHN,16,23,"On that day you will not ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.","Echiro echo timurimbhaza bhibhazo. Yesige, Yesige, nibhagambhira, Kimurasabha chona chona ahali Tata, najakubhaha omwibhara ryange."
184614936,JHN,16,24,"Until now you have not asked anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy will be fulfilled.","Mpaka ati timukasabhire chona chona omwibhara ryange; sabha, neimwe nimuja kubhona ili amasemererwa ganyu gagobheserezwe."
184614937,JHN,16,25,"""I have said these things to you in figures of speech, but the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but instead I will tell you plainly about the Father.","Ngambhire neimwe omururimi rutakumanyika, Chonka ati neija tindabhasa kufomora omururimi rutakumanyika chonka nijakubhagambhira omubhutasherekangana ebhikwasire ahali Tata."
184614938,JHN,16,26,"On that day you will ask in my name and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,","Echiro echo nimuja kusabha omwibhara ryange, na tikubhagambhira kwambha nijakusabha owa Tata arwanyu;"
184614939,JHN,16,27,for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and because you have believed that I came from God.,Okwo kubha Tata wenka nabhenda obhwensonga mungondize nyawe norwokubha munyesigire kugira ngu ndugire owa Tata.

184614941,JHN,16,29,"His disciples said, ""See, now you are speaking plainly and you are not using figures of speech.","Abhegesibhwa bha wenene bhamugambhira, Norebha, ati nogambha bhitari nserekwa na tokuseraka."
184614942,JHN,16,30,"Now we know that you know all things, and you do not need anyone to ask you questions. Because of this, we believe that you have come from God.""","Ati, nitumanya kwambha nomanya ebhintu bhyona, tokwenda muntu wena wena akubhaze ebhibhazo. Obhwe ensonga eji nitwesiga  kwambha noruga owa Katonda."
184614943,JHN,16,31,"Jesus answered them, ""Do you believe now?","Yesu abhaorora, ''ati nayesiga?''"
184614944,JHN,16,32,"See, the hour is coming, yes, and has indeed come, when you will be scattered, everyone to his own home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.","Rebha, akanya nikaja kwija, mazima gagobha, nimujakwebhegana bhuri omo no omubhanyu nimujakusigaho nyenka. Chonka tindinyenka obhwensonga Tata ari amo nanye."
184614945,JHN,16,33,"I have spoken these things to you so that you will have peace in me. In the world you have tribulation. But have courage! I have conquered the world.""","Nibhagambhira ebhintu ebhi ili kwambha omunda yange  mugire emirembhe. Omunsi mwine eshida, Chonka mwegumisirize, najisinga ensi."
184619009,JHN,17,1,"After Jesus said these things, he lifted up his eyes to the heavens and said, ""Father, the hour has come, glorify your Son so that the Son will glorify you—","Yesu akagambha ebhintu ebhyo; Ashubha arebha ahiguru na ameiso gawenene agambha,''Tata, akanya kagobha; singiza omwana wawe ili no omwana nawe akusingize iwe-"

184619013,JHN,17,5,"Now, Father, glorify me along with yourself with the glory that I had with you before the world was made.","Ati, Tata, onsingize nyawe amo neiwe wenka omubhurora bhurinya obhunabheire nyine amo neiwe obhwensi yabheire etakabheireho."
184619014,JHN,17,6,"I revealed your name to the people whom you gave me from the world.

184619016,JHN,17,8,"for I have given them all the words that you gave me.

184619020,JHN,17,12,"While I was with them, I kept them safe in your name, which you have given me. I guarded them, and not one of them was destroyed, except for the son of destruction, so that the scriptures would be fulfilled.","Kinabheire ndinabho, nkabharinda ne eibhara riwampeire; Nikabharinda, na tariho nomo eyabhuzire sana omwana eyabhuzire, ili echigambho chigobheserezwe."

184623105,JHN,18,1,"After Jesus spoke these words, he went out with his disciples to the other side of the Kidron Brook, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered.","Kiyamazire kugambha ebhigambho ebhyo, akagenda na abhegesibhwa bhawenene kuja omurusa rwa Kidroni, akabha ariyo ebhusitani, wenene na abhagesibhwa bha wenene bhakataha omunda ya yonene."
184623106,JHN,18,2,"Now Judas, who was going to betray him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples.","Ogwo Yuda, eyabheire nayenda kumwanga, nawe akabha namanya echichweka echo, Yesu akabha nagenda omuchichweka echo eine abhegesibhwa bhawenene."
184623107,JHN,18,3,"Then Judas, leading a company of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.","Nawe Yuda, kiyabhweine yabhona echikundi cha abhaserikali na amaofisa kuruga omubhakauru bha amakuhani, bhakeija bheine etadobha, ne ekurunzi ne esiraha."
184623108,JHN,18,4,"Then Jesus, having known all the things that would happen to him, went forward and asked them, ""Who are you looking for?""","Nawe Yesu, akabha yamanyire echabheire nichikorwa abhwa wenene, akezora omumeiso  abhabhaza, ''Nohi ohumukuiga?''"
184623109,JHN,18,5,"They answered him, ""Jesus of Nazareth."" Jesus said to them, ""I am."" Judas, who betrayed him, was also standing with the soldiers.","Nabho bhamuorora, ''Yesu mnazareth. ""Yesu abhagambhira, Ninye aha'' Nawe Yuda eyamwangire, akabha ayemereire na abhaserikali ."
184623110,JHN,18,6,"So when he said to them, ""I am,"" they went backward and fell to the ground.","Kibhabhagambhire, ''Nyawe ninye'' bhakasubha enyuma bhagwa enture ahansi."
184623111,JHN,18,7,"Then again he asked them, ""Who are you looking for?"" Again they said, ""Jesus of Nazareth.""","Ashubha abhabhaza akandi, ''Nohi oumukuiga? Nabho bhamuorora ''Yesu omunazareth.''"
184623112,JHN,18,8,"Jesus answered, ""I told you that I am. So if you are looking for me, let these go.""","Yesu abhaorora, ''Ndabhagambhire nyawe ninye; kimurabha nimuiga nyawe, mubhareke abha abhandi bhegendere.''"
184623113,JHN,18,9,"This was in order to fulfill the word that he said: ""Of those whom you have given me, I lost no one.""","Ebhyo bhikabha bhityo ili echigambho chigobheserezwe; arinya kiyagambhire; ''Omuri bharinya abhampeire, tindanagire nomo.''"
184623114,JHN,18,10,"Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.","Niho simoni Petro, eyabheire eine orupanka, arweyayo amutema okutu  kwa bhuryo omukozi wa kuhani omukuru. Eibhara ryogwo omukozi akabha nayetwa Malko."
184623115,JHN,18,11,"Jesus said to Peter, ""Put the sword back into its sheath. Should I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?""","Yesu agambhira Petro, ''Shubhyaho orupanka rwawe ahiwamutema. Kubhaki ntayweramu echikompe chirinya echampeire Tata?''"
184623116,JHN,18,12,"So a company of soldiers and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and tied him up.","Bharinya abhaserikali na abhajemedari, na abhakozi bha Abhayuda, bhakamukwata Yesu bhamukoma."
184623117,JHN,18,13,"They led him first to Annas, for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.","Nabho bhamutwara mpaka ahali Anasi, kubha wenene akabha ali mazara wa Kayafa, eyabheire ali kuhani omukuru amwaka ogwo."
184623118,JHN,18,14,Now Caiaphas was the one who had given the advice to the Jews that it would be better that one man die for the people.,Obhwo Kayafa niwe yabheire abhaeire  efomoro Abhayuda kwambha omuntu omo afe abhwa abhantu bheingi.
184623119,JHN,18,15,"Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest;","Simoni Petro akamuondera Yesu, bhatyo abhegesibhwa abhandi. No orinya omwegesibhwa eyabheire namanyika ahali kuhani omukuru, nawe akatahamu amo na Yesu omuri behewa ya kuhani omukuru;"
184623120,JHN,18,16,"but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and he brought Peter in.","Chonka Petro akabha ayemereire aheru yo omuryango. Ogwo omwegesibhwa eyabheire namanyika ahali kuhani omukuru, akashoora aheru kufumora no orinya omukazi omukozi eyabheire nalinda omuryango  ataya Petro omunda."
184623121,JHN,18,17,"Then the female servant, the doorkeeper, said to Peter, ""Are you not also one of the disciples of this man?"" He said, ""I am not.""","Ogwo omukozi eyabheire narinda amuryango, akamugambhira Petro, ''Isi iwe tori  amo no omuntu ogu?Na wenene akagambha, ''Nyawe chehi.''"
184623122,JHN,18,18,"Now the servants and the officers were standing there, and they had made a charcoal fire, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was also with them, standing there and warming himself.","Na bharinya abhakozi na abhakuru bhakabha bhemereire arinya; bhaembhire omuriro gwingi muno, akabha ariyo embheho, chityo bhakabha nibhota omuriro bhabhase kubhona obhutagasi. Nawe Petro akabha abheine, nayota  omuriro ayemereire."
184623123,JHN,18,19,The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.,Kuhani omukuru akamubhaza Yesu abhwa abhegesibhwa bhawenene na ebhyegeso bhya wenene.
184623124,JHN,18,20,"Jesus answered him, ""I have spoken openly to the world. I was always teaching in synagogues and in the temple where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.","Yesu akamuorora, ""Ngambhire obhutashereka ensi; Nyawe nkegesa emara zingi omumasinagogi no omumakanisa omuchichweka cha abhayuda bhatanganirwe. Nanye tindagambhire chona chona omukusereka."
184623125,JHN,18,21,"Why did you ask me? Ask those who have heard me about what I said. Look, these people know what I said.""",Kubhaki mukambhaza?Mbhabhaze bharinya abhampurire ahali chirinya echinagambhire. Abho nibhamanya ebhintu ebhyo ebhinagambhire.
184623126,JHN,18,22,"When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing there struck Jesus and said, ""Is that how you answer the high priest?""","Yesu kiyamazire kugambha atyo, omukuru omo eyabheire ayemereire atera yesu no omukono gwa wenene ashubha  agambha, ''Isi, ebhi nikwo okupaswa kuorora kuhani omukuru?''"
184623127,JHN,18,23,"Jesus answered him, ""If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong, but if rightly, why do you hit me?""","Na wenene yesu ahorora, ''Kidabha nagambha echitu chona chona echibhi aho obhe omujulizi abhwo obhufu, na kidabha namuororage kubhaki ontere?"
184623128,JHN,18,24,Then Annas sent him tied up to Caiaphas the high priest.,Nibhwo Anasi yamutweire Yesu ahali Kayafa kuhani omukuru akabha akomirwe.
184623129,JHN,18,25,"Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. The people then said to him, ""Are you not also one of his disciples?"" He denied it and said, ""I am not.""","Arwecho Simoni Petro akabha ayemereire nayota omuriro wenene. Bharinya abhantu bhamugambhira. ''Isi, iwe tori mwegesibhwa wa wenene? ''Ayanga nagambha ''Nyawe tindi wenene.''"
184623130,JHN,18,26,"One of the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, ""Did I not see you in the garden with him?""","Omukozi omo owa kuhani omukuru, eyabheire ari omurumuna  wo orinya omuseija ohu Petro yatemire okutu, akagambha, ''Isi tiwe ohumbhweine na wenene kurinya omubhusitani?''"
184623131,JHN,18,27,Then Peter denied it again; and immediately the rooster crowed.,"Petro ayanga tena, aho esaki ekokoroma."
184623132,JHN,18,28,"Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the government headquarters. It was early in the morning, and they did not enter the government headquarters so that they would not be defiled but would be able to eat the Passover.",Obhwo bhamutwara Yesu kuruga owa Kayafa mpaka okwo Praitorio. likabha richali bhwancha muno.

184623133,JHN,18,29,"So Pilate went out to them and said, ""What accusation are you bringing against this man?""",Chityo Pilato abhagendera nagambha. ''ni ikosa ki erimukumutwejerera ogu omuntu?''
184623134,JHN,18,30,"They answered and said to him, ""If this man was not an evildoer, we would not have given him over to you.""","Bhamuhorora mbhamugambhira, ''ogu omuntu kiyakubheire atakukora ebhibhi, titwakumuresire aha iwe.''"
184623135,JHN,18,31,"Pilate therefore said to them, ""Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law."" The Jews said to him, ""It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.""","Pilato amugambhira, Mumutware imwe bhenyewe, mumuramure nka abhwo omuku gwanyu. ""Nabho Abhayuda bhamugambhira, ''Omuku tigukutujubhura kwita omuntu wena wena.''"
184623136,JHN,18,32,They said this so that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled which he had spoken to indicate by what kind of death he would die.,"Bhakagambha ebhyo ili echigambho cha Yesu chigobheserezwe, echigambho echiyabheire  yagambhire  achikwasire aha rufu rwa wenene."
184623137,JHN,18,33,"Then Pilate entered the government headquarters again and called Jesus, and he said to him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?""","Aho Pilato aja omuri Praitorio amweta Yesu; amugambhira, ''Isi, iwe ori omukama wa Abhayuda?''"
184623138,JHN,18,34,"Jesus answered, ""Do you speak from yourself, or did others speak to you about me?""","Yesu amuorora, ''Isi iwe wabhaza echibhazo echi obhwensonga noyenda kumanya nanga abhandi bhakutuma obhase kubhaza nyawe?''"
184623139,JHN,18,35,"Pilate answered, ""I am not a Jew, am I? Your own people and the chief priests gave you over to me. What did you do?""","Nawe Pilato amuorora, ''Nyawe tindi Myuda, nanga tikwo? ''Ehiyanga ryawe na kuhani omukuru  nibho bhakureta ahali nyawe; iwe wakoraki?"
184623140,JHN,18,36,"Jesus answered, ""My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, then my servants would fight so that I would not be given over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.""","Yesu akaorora, ''Obhukama bhwange ti bhwansi  eji, kibhwakubha obhukama bhwange no obhwe echichweka echi omunsi eji  entumwa zange zakundwanirire nitabhasa kutekwa abhayuda.

184623141,JHN,18,37,"Pilate then said to him, ""Are you a king then?"" Jesus answered, ""You say that I am a king. For this purpose I have been born, and for this purpose I have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.""","Pilato akamwambhia, ''Isi ,iwe aho oryo omukama?

Wena wena  ali wa ago amazima naurira ehiraka ryange."
184623142,JHN,18,38,"Pilate said to him, ""What is truth?"" When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, ""I find no guilt in this man.","Pilato amugambhira, ''Amazima ni gahi?''

184623143,JHN,18,39,"But you have the custom that I release one person to you at the Passover. So do you want me to release the King of the Jews to you?""",Imwe mwine emiiko ekunkora nkomorore omubhwowa omo omuri Pasaka.Isi nimwenda mukomorore  omukama wa Abhayuda.''
184623144,JHN,18,40,"Then they cried out again and said, ""Not this man, but Barabbas."" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.","Bhasubha bhatera enduru mbhagambha, tiwe ogu,tukomororere Baraba. ''Nawe Baraba akabha aryomusuma."
184627201,JHN,19,1,Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him.,Abhwo pilato akamutwara Yesu  amutera ekoni.
184627202,JHN,19,2,The soldiers wove a crown of thorns. They put it on the head of Jesus and dressed him with a purple garment.,Bharinya abhaserikali bharuka amawa bhakora ehitaji. Bhariteka ahiguru yo omutwe gwa Yesu bhamujweka echijwaro echo okuzoka nka zambharau.
184627203,JHN,19,3,"They came to him and said, ""Hail, King of the Jews!"" and they struck him.","Bhamuorora mbhagambha, ''Iwe mukama wa Abhayuda! bhasubha bhamutera ne emikono yabho."
184627204,JHN,19,4,"Then Pilate went outside again and said to them, ""See, I am bringing him outside to you so that you will know that I find no guilt in him.""","Aho pilato ashoora aheru abhagambhira abhantu, ''Rebha nibharetera ogu omuntu omuri imwe mbhase kumanya nyawe  tinabhona ehikosa ryona ryona omunda yawenene.''"
184627205,JHN,19,5,"So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, ""Look, here is the man!""","Yesu ashoora aheru; akabha ajweire  amawa ne echijwaro che ezabharau.Niho Pilato yabhagambhire, ''Rebha omuntu ni wogu aha!''"
184627206,JHN,19,6,"When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they cried out and said, ""Crucify him, crucify him!"" Pilate said to them, ""Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.""","Obhwa akanya ka kuhani omukuru wa abhakuru kiyamubhweine Yesu, bhakatera enduru mbhagambha, Omusase, omusase.''Pilato abhagambhira, ''Mmutware imwe mumusase, kubha nyawe tikubhona ehikosa omunda yawenene.''"
184627207,JHN,19,7,"The Jews answered him, ""We have a law, and according to that law he has to die because he claimed to be the Son of God.""","Abhayuda bhakamuhorora Pilato, ''Itwe twine omuku, obhwo omuku ogwo asanire kufa obhwensanga akekora kubha omwana wa Katonda.''"
184627208,JHN,19,8,"When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid,","Pilato kiyahurire ebhigambho ebhyo akatina muno,"
184627209,JHN,19,9,"and he entered the government headquarters again and said to Jesus, ""Where do you come from?"" But Jesus gave him no answer.","Ataha Praitorio asubha amugambhira Yesu, ''Iwe noruga nkahi? Nobhwo, Yesu taramuorohire."
184627210,JHN,19,10,"Then Pilate said to him, ""Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and authority to crucify you?""","Nibhwo pilato yabhagambhire, ''Isi, iwe tokugambha nanye? Isi, iwe tokumanya nyawe nyine obhubhasa bhwo okukukomorora no obhubhasa bhwo kukusasa?''"
184627211,JHN,19,11,"Jesus answered him, ""You do not have any authority over me except for what has been given to you from above. Therefore, he who gave me over to you has a greater sin.""","Yesu akamuhorora, ''Wakubheire weine amani kusaga kubha waehibhwe kuruga ahiguru. Chityo, omuntu eyanta ahaliwe eine entambhara mpango.''"
184627212,JHN,19,12,"At this answer, Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, ""If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.""","Kuringana no okusobhorora okwo, Pilato akenda kumureka omubhuge, Chonka Abhayuda bhakatera enduru nibhagambha, ''Koramureka omubhuge iwe nojakubha otari munywani wa Keisari:Bhuri akwekora omukama nagambha nkokupinga keisaria.''"
184627213,JHN,19,13,"When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place called ""The Pavement,"" but in the Aramaic language, ""Gabbatha.""","Pilato kiyahurire ebhigambho ebhyo, akamureta Yesu aheru asitama ahatebhe ye ehiramu echichweka echo mpamanyika nka asakafu, omururimi rwe ekiebhurania nikwokugambha, Gabatha."
184627214,JHN,19,14,"Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover, at about the sixth hour. Pilate said to the Jews, ""See, here is your king!""","Echiro cho okuhandaa epasaka kichagobhire, akanya ke esaa mukaga. Pilato abhagambhira Abhayuda, ''Rebha omuka wanyu ni wogu aha!''"
184627215,JHN,19,15,"They cried out, ""Away with him, away with him; crucify him!"" Pilate said to them, ""Should I crucify your King?"" The chief priests answered, ""We have no king but Caesar.""","Bhakatera enduru, ''Mwiyeho, mwiyeho, musase!''Pilato abhagambhira, ''Isi musase omukama wanyu?''Na wenene kuhani omukuru ahorora, ''Itwe titwine omukama sana Kaisari.''"
184627216,JHN,19,16,Then Pilate gave Jesus over to them to be crucified.,Niho Pilato yaresire Yesu omuri bhonene bhabhase kumusasa.
184627217,JHN,19,17,"Then they took Jesus, and he went out, carrying the cross for himself, to the place called ""The Place of a Skull,"" which in the Aramaic language is called ""Golgotha.""","Nabho bhakamutwara Yesu, nawe arugayo, ahekire omusalabha gwa wenene wenka mpaka echichweka  echabheire nichetwa  ebhinoko bhyo omutwe, omururimi rwe ekieburania mbhagambha Golgotha."
184627218,JHN,19,18,"They crucified Jesus there, and with him two other men, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.","Niho bhamusasire Yesu, amo na wenene na abhasheija bhabhili, omo orubhaju oru no ondijo orubhaju oru, nawe Yesu akabha aryomugati yabho."
184627219,JHN,19,19,"Pilate also wrote a sign and put it on the cross. There it was written: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.","Pilato ahandika echereko achiteka ahiguru yo omusalabha.Akahandikaho: YESU MNAZARETH, OMUKAMA WA ABHAYUDA."
184627220,JHN,19,20,"Many of the Jews read this sign because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. The sign was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.","Bheingi abhayuda bhakasoma echereko echo kubha hao Yesu ahiyateseizwe akabha ali hei ne echigo. Echereko echo chikahandikwa omururimi rwe Kiebrania, omukiroma no omukiyunani."
184627221,JHN,19,21,"Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, ""Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but rather, 'This one said, ""I am King of the Jews.""'""","Obhwo abhakuru bha amakuhani na Abhayuda bhamugambhira Pilato, ''Otahandika, 'Omukama wa abhayuda; sana wenene akagambha no omukama wa abhayaudi.''"
184627222,JHN,19,22,"Pilate answered, ""What I have written I have written.""","Nawe Pilato abhaorora, ''Ebhipandikire mpandikire.''"
184627223,JHN,19,23,"When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, divided them into four shares, one for each of them; and also the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.","Kibhamazire abhaserikali kumusasa Yesu, bhakatwara ebhijwaro bhya wenene bhagapanga omumifungo ena, bhuri omuserikali omuserikali omufungu gwa wenene gumo, chityo ne ekanzu, obhwo  erinya ekanzu ekabha etasonirwe sana ekabha efumirwe yona kuruga ahiguru."
184627224,JHN,19,24,"Then they said to each other, ""Let us not tear it, but instead let us cast lots for it to decide whose it will be."" This happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled which said, ""They divided my garments among themselves and cast lots for my clothing."" This is what the soldiers did.","Bhasubha bhagambhirana bhonene kwa bhonene, ''Tutajinyamura, sana tutere ekura turebhe nejakubha eyohi.''Echi chikazoka ebhiandiko  bhigobheserezwe, chilinya echokugambha bhakabhegana emyenda zange, ne echijwaro change bhakachiterera ekura.''"
184627225,JHN,19,25,"Now standing beside Jesus' cross were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.","Abhaserikali bhakakora ebhintu ebhyo.

184627226,JHN,19,26,"When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, ""Woman, see, your son!""","Yesu kiyabhweine nyina wa wenene amo nogwo omwegesibhwa  ohuyabheire nayenda bhemereire hei,amugambhira nyina wa wenene, ''Omukazi, rebha, nobhona omwana ngugu haa!''"
184627227,JHN,19,27,"Then he said to the disciple, ""See, your mother!"" From that hour the disciple took her to his own home.","Amugambhira ogwo omwegesibhwa, ''Rebha niwogu aha nyoko wawe. ""Kuruga omwaya ogwo orinya omwegesibhwa amutwara kugenda omunju yawenene."
184627228,JHN,19,28,"After this, knowing that everything was now accomplished and so that the scriptures would be fulfilled, Jesus said, ""I am thirsty.""","Echo kichawehire, Yesu akabha namanya bhyona bhyawa kugobhesereza ebhiandikirwe, agambha, ''Nibhona ehiriho.''"
184627229,JHN,19,29,"A container full of sour wine was placed there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop staff and lifted it up to his mouth.","Echombho echabheire chijwire esiki chikabha chiteirwe hao, bhatekaho esifongo ehijuire esiki ahiguru yo orubhingo rwe hisopo, bhamuteka omukanwa kawenene."
184627230,JHN,19,30,"When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, ""It is finished."" He bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","Nawe Yesu kiyarorize ejo, agambha, ''Bhyawa.'' ashubha ehinamisa omutwe gwa wenene, agutwara omwoyo gwa wenene."
184627231,JHN,19,31,"Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was especially important), asked Pilate to break their legs and to remove them.","Kubha guli omwanya gwa amaandariho, omubhili gwona gwona gukabha gutakwendwa kusigara ahiguru yo omusarabha omukanya ke eirimansi (kubha eirimansi chikabha chili echiro che ensonga), abhayuda bhakasabha Pilato amaguru gabho bharinya abhabhambhirwe amusarabha gaendwe, n'e emibhiri yabho bhajianure."
184627232,JHN,19,32,Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the second man who had been crucified with Jesus.,Nibhwo abhaserikali bheija kuenda amaguru ga abhantu owambhere no owa kabhiri eyabheire ashurubhiswe amo na Yesu.
184627233,JHN,19,33,"When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they did not break his legs.","Kibhamugobhire Yesu, bhakasanga arafile, obhwo tibharaenzire maguru ga wenene."
184627234,JHN,19,34,"However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.","Nangu chityo, omo omuserikali akamuchumita Yesu orubhaju ne eichumu, na mara arugamu ameizi no obhwambha."
184627235,JHN,19,35,"The one who saw this has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that what he said is true so that you may also believe.","Nawe eyabhweine echi akareta obhujurizi, no obhujulizi bhwa wenene bhukabha bhuri bhwa amazima. Na wenene namanya echiyagambhire ne echamazima neimwe mubhase kwesiga."
184627236,JHN,19,36,"For these things happened in order to fulfill scripture, ""Not one of his bones will be broken.""","Ebhintu ebhi bhikabha ili chilinya echigambho echagambhire chibhase kugobheserezwa, ''Tariho nagumo ogwawenene oguraendwa.''"
184627237,JHN,19,37,"Again, another scripture says, ""They will look at him whom they pierced.""","Echindi echigambho nichigambha, ''Nibhajakurebha wenene ohubhachumisire''"
184627238,JHN,19,38,"After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, since he was a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate if he could take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission. So Joseph came and took away his body.","Ebhyo kibhyaweire Yusufu owa Arimathaya,

184627239,JHN,19,39,"Nicodemus also came—he who at first had come to Jesus by night. He brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred litras.","Nawe Nicodemu  obhwambhere akabha ahondeire Yesu omuchiro nawe akeija. Wenene akareta oruchange rwe emanemane ne eudi, bhikabha mbhisikira mpaka obhusikizi bhwe eratili chikumi."
184627240,JHN,19,40,"So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, as was the custom of the Jews to bury bodies.","Bhakagutwara omubhili gwa Yesu
bhakagukoma omusanda eye ekatani amo na garinya amarashi, nkwo kwo bhyabheire bhiteirweho ebhiteko teko bhya Abhayuda omukanya ko okuzika."
184627241,JHN,19,41,Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden was a new tomb in which no person had yet been buried.,Echichweka chi Yesu yashashirwe akabha ariyo ebhusitani; omuryejo ebhusitani akabha arimu echituro echibhatakazikiremu omuntu.
184627242,JHN,19,42,"Because it was the day of preparation for the Jews and because the tomb was close by, they laid Jesus in it.","Obhwo, kubha chikabha chiri echiro cha amaandario ga Abhayuda, norwokubha echituro kikabha kiri hei, aho bhamunyamikamu Yesu omunda ya yonene."
184631297,JHN,20,1,"Now early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb, and she saw the stone rolled away from the tomb.","Kare echiro cha mbhere echokubhanza, gukabha guchari omwilima, Mariamu Magdalena akagenda achituro; abhona ririnya ehibhare bharihireho achituro."
184631298,JHN,20,2,"So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and she said to them, ""They took away the Lord out from the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.""","Aho ehiruka muno kuja owa Simoni Petro no owo omwegesibhwa ohu Yesu yabheire nayenda muno, abhagambhira,''Bhatwara Mukama kuruga omuchituro, neitwe titukumanya okwo ahibhamunyamikire.''"
184631299,JHN,20,3,"Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and they were going to the tomb.","Abhwo petro no omwegesibhwa ondijo bhagenda, kuja achituro."
184631300,JHN,20,4,"They both ran together, and the other disciple quickly ran ahead of Peter and arrived at the tomb first.",Bhona bhakeiruka hamo; no orinya omwegesibhwa ondijo akeruka muno kusaga Petro agobha achituro ariwambhere.
184631301,JHN,20,5,"Then stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go inside.","Ayemerera  asubha arebha omuchituro; abhona elinya esanda eye ekatani eyamile, Sana tarataire munda."
184631302,JHN,20,6,Simon Peter then arrived after him and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there,Niho Simoni Petro yagobhireho akataha omunda ye echituro. Abhona esanda  ye ekatani eyamile alinya
184631303,JHN,20,7,and the cloth that had been on his head. It was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up in a place by itself.,Na chirinya echitambhara echabheire chiri omumutwe gwawenene chikabha chitanyamire amo na zirinya esanda eze ekatani sana chikabha chinyamile chonka.
184631304,JHN,20,8,"Then the other disciple, the one who first arrived at the tomb, also went in, and he saw and believed.",Niho ogwo omwegesibhwa ondijo nawe kiyataire omuchituro; arebha kandi ayesiga.
184631305,JHN,20,9,For until that time they still did not know the scripture that he should rise from the dead.,Kubha mpaka hao bhakabha bhatakamanyire ebhihandikirwe chikabha chisanire Yesu azikurwe omubhafu.
184631306,JHN,20,10,So the disciples went back home again.,Abhegesibhwa  bhasubha howabho .
184631307,JHN,20,11,"But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she stooped down into the tomb.","Nangu chityo, Mariamu akabha ayemereire achituro narila, kiyabheire nagenderera kurira akemerera  arebha omuchituro."
184631308,JHN,20,12,"She saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the foot of where the body of Jesus had lain.",Arebha bhamaraika bhabhili abheine esura ekwera bhasitamire omo amutwe no ondijo omumaguru aho yesu yabheire ayamire.
184631309,JHN,20,13,"They said to her, ""Woman, why are you weeping?"" She said to them, ""Because they took away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him.""","Nabhonene bhamugambhira, ''Omukazi, kubhaki norila?'' Nawenene  abhagambhira, ''NO orwokubha  bhatweire Mukama wange, nanyawe tikumanya ahibhamuteire.''"
184631310,JHN,20,14,"When she said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.","Kiyamazire kugambha ebhyo, ainduka abhona Yesu ayemereire. Chonka taramanyire karabha yabheire ari Yesu."

184631315,JHN,20,19,"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the middle of them and said to them, ""Peace to you.""","Kiryabheire bhweigoro, echiro echo, echiro cha mbhere echebhiro, ne emiryango ekabha ekomirwe abhegesibhwa ahibhabheire bhari nibhatina Abhayuda, Yesu akeija yayemerera omugati yabho abhagambhira, Emirembhe ebhe omuri imwe.''"

184631321,JHN,20,25,"The other disciples later said to him, ""We have seen the Lord."" He said to them, ""Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails,  and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.""","Bharinya abhegesibhwa abhandi bhamugambhira akanya kikarabhireho, ''Tubhweine Mukama.''

184631326,JHN,20,30,"Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, signs that have not been written in this book,","Obhwo Yesu akereka ebhyerekwa bhingi omumeiso ga abhegesibhwa, ebhitakahandikagwa  omuchitabho echi,"
184631327,JHN,20,31,"but these have been written so that you would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that believing, you would have life in his name.","Sana ezi zihandikirwe mubhase kusiga kugira Yesu niwe Kristo, omwana wa Katonda, chisane chiti kimurayesiga mugire obhurora omwibhara ryawenene."
184635393,JHN,21,1,After these things Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. This is how he revealed himself:,Kibhamazire ebhintu ebhyo Yesu akeyereka emara edijo omubhegesibhwa omunyanja ya Tiberia; oku nikwo yayeyerekire wenene :
184635394,JHN,21,2,"Simon Peter was together with Thomas called Didymus, Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus.","Simoni petro akabha ari hamo na Thomaso eyabheire nayetwa Didimasi, Nathanaeli wa kana eya Galilaya,abhana bha Zebedayo na abhegesibhwa bhabhili abha Yesu."
184635395,JHN,21,3,"Simon Peter said to them, ""I am going fishing.""  They said to him, ""We, too, will come with you.""  They went and got into a boat, but they caught nothing during the whole night.","Simoni Petro abhagambhira, ''itwe, nitujakugenda neiwe.'' Bhagenda bhaja omumashua, chonka omuchiro chona echo tibhabhweine chona chona."
184635396,JHN,21,4,"Now, when it was already early in the morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.","Na bhwancha kibhwacheire, Yesu akemerera ahatari meizi, nabho abhegesibhwa tibharamanyire kubha akabha ari Yesu."
184635397,JHN,21,5,"So Jesus said to them, ""Young men, do you have anything to eat?"" They answered him, ""No.""","Yesu abhagambhira, ''bhasigazi, mwine chona chona echokurya? ''Nabho bhamuorora, ''Chei.''"
184635398,JHN,21,6,"He said to them, ""Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some."" So they threw their net and were not able to draw it in because of the large number of fish.","Abhagambhira, ''Teka obhutimbha orubhaju rwa bhuryo rwe emasua, neimwe nimujakubhona agarau.''echaondeireho bhatamu obhutimbha bhwabho tibhabhasize kunyurura obhwo kubha efuru zikakanya."
184635399,JHN,21,7,"Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ""It is the Lord."" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tied up his outer garment (for he was undressed), and threw himself into the sea.","Ogwo omwegesibhwa owo Yesu yabheire nayenda amugambhira Petro, ''Ni Mukama.'' Nawe Simoni Petro yahurire kubha ni Mukama, akekoma echijwaro cha wenene (kubha akabha atachijweirege), ayenaga omunyanja."
184635400,JHN,21,8,"The other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from the land, about two hundred cubits off), and they were pulling the net full of fish.","Bharinya abhegesibhwa abhandi bheija omumashua (kubha bhakabha bhatari are ne'irungu, obhureigwa bhwe emita chikumi kuruga ahatari meizi) nabhonene bhakabha nibhanyurura bhurinya obhutimbha obhwabheire bhwijuire efuru."
184635401,JHN,21,9,"When they got out upon the land, they saw a charcoal fire there and fish laid on it, with bread.","Kibhagobhire atari meizi, bhakabhona omuriro gwo omukara arinya  na ahiguru yagwonene akabha ariho efuru amo no omugate."
184635402,JHN,21,10,"Jesus said to them, ""Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.""","Yesu abhagambhira, ''Reta efuru zike ezimwajubha ati.''"
184635403,JHN,21,11,"Simon Peter then went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, 153 of them, but even with so many, the net was not torn.","Aho Simoni Petro agenda  anyurura bhurinya obhutimbha obhwabheire bhwijuire efuru ziango, zikabha nzigobha efurub153; igawa zikabha zili zingi, bhurinya obhutibha tibhuranyamukire."
184635404,JHN,21,12,"Jesus said to them, ""Come and eat breakfast.""  None of the disciples dared ask him, ""Who are you?"" They knew it was the Lord.","Yesu amugambhira, ""Ija mbhone echokukomorora akanwa. ""Tariho nomo omuri abhegesibhwa eyarengeise kumubhaza, ''Iwe oryohi?"" Bhakabha mbhamanya  okwali Mukama."
184635405,JHN,21,13,"Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them, and the fish also.","Yesu aija, atwara gurinya omugate, abhagabhira, akora atyo ne efuru ezo."
184635406,JHN,21,14,This was the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.,Ejo ekabha eryemara ya kasatu Yesu kwezora omubhegesibhwa bhawenene obhuyamazire kuzikurwa kuruga omubhafu.
184635407,JHN,21,15,"After they ate breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ""Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?"" Peter said to him, ""Yes Lord, you know that I love you."" Jesus said to him, ""Feed my lambs.""","Kibhamazire kukomorora akanwa, Yesu amugambhira Simoni Petro, ''Simoni omwana wa Yohana isi, nonyendabnyawe kusaga abha?Petro ahorora, Ego, Mukama; ''Iwe nomanya nyawe okwonkukwenda.''Yesu amugambhira, Orise abhana bhe entama bhange.''"
184635408,JHN,21,16,"He said to him again a second time, ""Simon son of John, do you love me?"" Peter said to him, ""Yes Lord, you know that I love you."" Jesus said to him, ""Shepherd my sheep.""","Amuga omurudi gwa kabhili, ''Simoni omwana wa Yona, isi, nonyenda?''Petro amugambhira, ''Ego,Mukama; iwe nomanya okwonkukwenda. ''Yesu amugambhira, ''Rebherera entama zange.''"
184635409,JHN,21,17,"He said to him a third time, ""Simon son of John, do you love me?"" Peter was sorrowful because Jesus had said to him a third time, ""Do you love me?"" He said to him, ""Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you."" Jesus said to him, ""Feed my sheep.","Amugambhira emara ya kasatu, ''Simoni, omwana wa Yohana, Isi nonyenda?'' Nawe Petro akatamwa obhwo yamugambhire emara ya kasatu, Isi iwe nonyenda?'' Na wenene amugambhira, Mukama, nomanya bhyona; nomanya okwonkukwenda. ''Yesu amugambhira, Orise entama zange."
184635410,JHN,21,18,"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you become old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will gird you and carry you where you will not want to go.""","Yesige, yesige, nikugambhira, kiwabheire ochari omusigazi okabha omanyire kujwara emyenda wenka nokugenda ona ona ahokwenda; Chonka korabha omugurusi, nojakwimucha  emikono yawe, no ondijo najakukujweka ebhijwaro no okukutwara haotakwenda kuja.''"
184635411,JHN,21,19,"Now Jesus said this in order to indicate with what kind of death Peter would glorify God.  After he had said this, he said to Peter, ""Follow me.""","Yesu akagambha ebhyo abhase kwereka ehaina yo orufu orwo Petro yakusingize Katonda. Kiyamazire kugambha ebhyo, amugambhira Petro, ''Npondera.''"
184635412,JHN,21,20,"Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had also leaned back against the side of Jesus at the dinner and who had said, ""Lord, who is the one who will betray you?""","Petro ahinduka abhona ogwo omwegesibhwa ohu Yesu yabheire nayenda abhaondera-Ogu niwe eyabheire agwire omuchifubha cha Yesu omukanya ke echakurya cha bhweigoro  amubhaza, ''Mukama, noi arakwetonga?''"
184635413,JHN,21,21,"Peter saw him and then said to Jesus, ""Lord, what will this man do?""","Petro akamubhona   amubhaza Yesu, ''Mukama ogu omuntu najakukoraki?''"
184635414,JHN,21,22,"Jesus said to him, ""If I want him to stay until I come, what is that to you? Follow me.""","Yesu ahorora, ''Nijakubha ninyenda agumeho mpaka aindagarukira, echo chikukwasirehoki? ''Npondera.''"
184635415,JHN,21,23,"So this statement spread among the brothers, that that disciple would not die.  Yet Jesus did not say to Peter that the other disciple would not die, but, ""If I want him to stay until I come, what is that to you?""","Chityo ebhigambho bhegenderera omuri bharinya abharumuna, kugira omwegesibhwa ogwo najakufa.

184635417,JHN,21,25,"There are also many other things that Jesus did. If each one were written down, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.","Ariyo ebhintu bhingi ebhi yesu yakozire.
